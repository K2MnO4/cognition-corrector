The grief process is normal, and most people go through it. But when grief takes over your life and you begin to feel hopeless, helpless, and worthless, then it's time to talk to your doctor about telling the difference between normal grief and depression. Grief is a natural response to death or loss. The grieving process is an opportunity to appropriately mourn a loss and then heal. The process is helped when you acknowledge grief, find support, and allow time for grief to work. Each year, between 5% and 9% of the population loses a close family member. But that's not the only kind of loss that can cause grief. People can feel loss when: They become separated from a loved one They lose a job, position, or income A pet dies or runs away Kids leave home They have a major change in life such as getting a divorce, moving, or retiring While we all feel grief and loss, and each of us is unique in the ways we cope with our feelings. Some people have healthy coping skills. They're able to feel grief without losing sight of their daily responsibilities. Other people don't have the coping skills or support they need. That hinders the grieving process. There are specific stages of grief. They reflect common reactions people have as they try to make sense of a loss. An important part of the healing process is feeling and accepting the emotions that come as a result of the loss. People go through common stages of grief: Denial, numbness, and shock: Numbness is a normal reaction to a death or loss and should never be confused with \"not caring.\" This stage of grief helps protect us from experiencing the intensity of the loss. It can be useful when we have to take some action, such as planning a funeral, notifying relatives, or reviewing important papers. As we move through the experience and slowly acknowledges its impact, the initial denial and disbelief fades. Bargaining: This stage of grief may be marked by persistent thoughts about what \"could have been done\" to prevent the death or loss. Some people become obsessed with thinking about specific ways things could have been done differently to save the person's life or prevent the loss. If this stage of grief isn't dealt with and resolved, the person may live with intense feelings of guilt or anger that can interfere with the healing process. Depression: In this stage, we begin to realize and feel the true extent of the death or loss. Common signs of depression in this stage include trouble sleeping, poor appetite, fatigue, lack of energy, and crying spells. We may also have self-pity and feel lonely, isolated, empty, lost, and anxious. Anger: This stage is common. It usually happens when we feel helpless and powerless. Anger can stem from a feeling of abandonment because of a death or loss. Sometimes we're angry at a higher power, at the doctors who cared for a lost loved one, or toward life in general. Acceptance: In time, we can come to terms with all the emotions and feelings we experienced when the death or loss happened. Healing can begin once the loss becomes integrated into our set of life experiences. Throughout our lives, we may return to some of the earlier stages of grief, such as depression or anger. Because there are no rules or time limit to the grieving process, everyone's healing process will be different. Some things can impede or slow down the healing process following a death or loss. They include: Avoiding emotions Compulsive behaviors Minimizing feelings Overworking on the job Misusing drugs, alcohol, or other substances as a way to deal with emotional discomfort Acknowledge and accept both positive and negative feelings. Allow plenty of time to experience thoughts and feelings. Confide in a trusted person about the loss. Express feelings openly or write journal entries about them. Find bereavement groups in which there are other people who've had similar losses. Remember that crying can provide a release. Seek professional help if feelings are overwhelming. If grief continues and causes a prolonged and deep depression with physical symptoms such as poor sleep, loss of appetite, weight loss, and even thoughts of suicide, you may have a condition known as complicated bereavement. Talk with your doctor as soon as possible. Sometimes, a major depression can develop along with the normal feelings of loss or sadness linked with grief. Whereas normal sadness as part of a grief reaction may subside after several months, major depression is a medical disorder that is different from normal grief, can occur at any time (even in the immediate aftermath of a death of loss), and requires treatment to be resolved.", "question": "Can a doctor help me tell the difference between grief and depression?", "answer": ["The grief process is normal, and most people go through it.

If you have severe diarrhea and bleeding, you might need to go the hospital to prevent or treat dehydration, reduce your symptoms, and make sure you're getting the right nutrition. Your doctor may suggest several types of medicines to curb inflammation in your bowel, including sulfa drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and antibiotics. 5-aminosalicylic acid (5- ASA). Balsalazide, mesalamine, olsalazine, and sulfasalazine are the main medications used to treat ulcerative colitis. They come in pills and suppositories. Let your doctor know if you are allergic to sulfa before taking one of these drugs. He can prescribe a sulfa-free 5- ASA. Corticosteroids. These anti-inflammatory drugs can be used if 5- ASA drugs don't work for you or if you have more severe disease. These medicines sometimes have side effects and long-term complications, so doctors often suggest them for short periods of time to help you get in remission. Your doctor may then prescribe you a 5- ASA medication to keep your symptoms away for a longer period. Immunosuppressants. If corticosteroids or 5- ASA drugs don't help, your doctor may prescribe these kinds of drugs, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6- MP), azathioprine ( Azasan, Imuran), cyclosporine, and tacrolimus ( Astagraf XL, Envarsus XR, Prograf).

Your doctor may suggest diet changes, depending on your symptoms. He may also recommend vitamins or nutritional supplements. Some people get surgery to remove part or all of the colon. Your doctor may suggest this if your medicine isn't working, your symptoms get worse, or your ulcerative colitis leads to serious complications. When you have an operation to remove your entire colon, the surgeon most often creates an opening, or stoma, in your belly wall. He attaches a bag there and brings the tip of your lower small intestine through the opening. Waste passes through it and collects in a pouch, which gets attached to the stoma. You'd need to wear the pouch all the time. A newer surgery, called a pelvic pouch or ileal pouch anal anastomosis ( IPAA), doesn't create a permanent opening. Instead, a surgeon removes your colon and rectum, and your small intestine is used to form an internal pouch or reservoir that serves as a new rectum. This pouch is connected to the anus. A procedure called a continent ileostomy ( Kock pouch) is done if you want your external pouch converted to an internal one, or if you can't get the IPAA operation. In this procedure, there is a stoma but no bag. Your surgeon removes your colon and rectum and creates an internal reservoir from your small intestine. He makes an opening in your belly wall and joins the reservoir to your skin with a nipple valve. To drain the pouch, you insert a catheter through the valve into the internal reservoir.

The knee is the most commonly replaced joint in the body. But your orthopedic surgeon won't make the decision to operate lightly. They'll take your complete medical history, everything from your overall health to specifics about your knee pain and how it affects your life. You'll also have a physical exam so your surgeon can check out how your leg lines up and how much motion, strength, and stability you have in your knee. X-rays are a key tool. They'll give your surgeon a better idea of whether your bone is damaged or deformed. An imaging test called an MRI will give a more detailed look into the bone and soft tissues around your knee. You also may get a blood test to rule out, or point to, other causes for your knee pain. If your doctor decides a total knee replacement is the way to go, you can learn about how much it might help, possible complications, and what to expect after surgery.

You may have had a small hole in it or something more severe. Although these can be very serious conditions, many can be treated with surgery. In some cases, doctors can find these problems during pregnancy. You might not get symptoms until adulthood, or you may not get any at all. Doctors don't always know why a baby has a congenital heart defect. They tend to run in families. Things that make them more likely include: Problems with genes or chromosomes in the child, such as Down syndrome Taking certain medications, or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy A viral infection, like rubella ( German measles) in the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy Most congenital heart problems are structural issues like holes and leaky valves. For instance: Heart valve defects: One may be too narrow or completely closed. That makes it hard for blood to get through. Sometimes, it can't get through at all. In other cases, the valve might not close properly, so the blood leaks backward. Problems with the heart's \"walls\": It could be the ones between the chambers (atria and ventricles) of your heart. Holes or passageways between the left and right side of the heart might cause blood to mix when it shouldn't. Issues with the heart's muscle: These can lead to heart failure, which means the heart doesn't pump as efficiently as it should. Bad connections among blood vessels: In babies, this may let blood that should go to the lungs go to other parts of the body instead, or vice versa. These defects can deprive blood of oxygen and lead to organ failure. It's possible for you to have a heart-related birth defect and not have symptoms. If you do, they can include: Shortness of breath Problems with exercise The symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and children may include: A bluish tint to the skin, fingernails, and lips (doctors call this cyanosis, a condition caused by a lack of oxygenated blood) Fast breathing and poor feeding Poor weight gain Lung infections An inability to exercise Doctors may find some problems before a baby is born. Other problems may be found in infants, kids, or adults. The doctor listens to your heartbeat to check your health. If she hears an unusual sound or heart murmur, she might order more tests, such as: Echocardiogram: A type of ultrasound that takes pictures of your heart. There are different kinds, so ask your doctor what you can expect. Cardiac catheterization: A doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. She puts dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart. Chest X-ray: These can reveal signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG): This measures the heart's electrical activity. MRI : You get a scan that lets doctors see the heart's structure. You might not need any treatment. Or you may need medications, surgery, or other procedures. If you have congenital heart disease, you'll need to see a heart specialist on a regular basis. People with congenital heart defects are more likely to have inflammation of the inner layer of their heart (a condition doctors call endocarditis), especially if their heart was repaired or replaced through surgery. To protect yourself: Tell all doctors and dentists you have congenital heart disease. You may want to carry a card with this information. Call your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection (sore throat, general body aches, fever). Take good care of your teeth and gums to prevent infections. Make regular visits to your dentist. Take antibiotics before you have any medical work that may cause bleeding, like dental work and most surgeries. Check with your doctor about the type and amount of antibiotics that you should take.", "question": "How is congenital heart disease diagnosed?", "answer": ["If you do, they can include: Shortness of breath Problems with exercise The symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and children may include: A bluish tint to the skin, fingernails, and lips (doctors call this cyanosis, a condition caused by a lack of oxygenated blood) Fast breathing and poor feeding Poor weight gain Lung infections An inability to exercise Doctors may find some problems before a baby is born.

So take these steps to stay well: Try to avoid people with infections like colds or flu. Wash your hands regularly. Tell your doctor if you have fever, chills, or a cough. Don't take live vaccines like the nasal flu mist, measles, mumps, or shingles shots while you take methotrexate. Methotrexate can also: Cause lung problems. Tell your doctor if you cough frequently or have shortness of breath. Make lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system) more likely. Make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Use sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and don't use sunlamps or tanning beds. Cause birth defects. If you or your partner could get pregnant, you should use birth control while on methotrexate. Men should continue to use protection for 3 months after the last dose.

It's the first drug most doctors prescribe after you're diagnosed. It will help ease symptoms like joint pain, fatigue, redness, and swelling. It may also help prevent damage to your organs and joints. Methotrexate interrupts the process that causes RA inflammation, which damages your joints and organs over time. Your doctor may call it a â DMARD,â which is a type of RA drug. ( DMARD stands for disease-modifying antirheumatic drug). You can take methotrexate in either pills or shots. There are prefilled methotrexate shots that are easy to take at home. You will take 7.5 to 10 milligrams each week. Your doctor may raise that to 20-25 milligrams per week if needed. The pills will come with directions about how many to take and when. If you're not sure about those instructions, ask your doctor or a pharmacist. Shots work better for some people, especially if you forget to take your pills on schedule or if the pills cause nausea. Methotrexate liquid comes in vials with a hypodermic needle or in prefilled pens with various doses. You inject the drug under the skin on your stomach or thigh. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this at home. If you use a prefilled pen, you'll stick the pen into your stomach or thigh and press on it to inject the drug. Try to give yourself your shot in a different spot each time. This will help you avoid skin reactions. It can take 3 to 6 weeks to start to feel your methotrexate work. It takes even longer -- 12 weeks -- to get the full effects. Your doctor will test your blood often to check on how well your treatment works and to make sure it's safe for organs such as your liver. Your doctor may prescribe methotrexate alone. Or you may also take other drugs like aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, low-dose steroids, or other DMARDs. You'll probably take folic acid supplements along with methotrexate. This vitamin can help you lower your chance of certain side effects. Talk to your doctor before you take any drug or supplement. Not all drugs mix well. You may notice these side effects while you take methotrexate: Dizziness Drowsiness Headaches Swollen or tender gums Hair loss Decreased appetite Mouth sores Rash Diarrhea Tell your doctor if you have them.

Early research shows benefits for this hard-to-treat form of cancer. Mesothelioma often starts in your pleura, a thin lining between your lung and the inside of your chest. Usually, it affects people who've breathed in asbestos, a material used in roofing and insulation. Tiny asbestos fibers go into your lungs and cause cancer cells to grow in the lining. Right now, the only FDA-approved mesothelioma treatments are chemotherapy, like cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pemetrexed. Doctors are looking at other options, like immunotherapy, that could offer hope. Where Is Immunotherapy Now? Larger clinical trials with more mesothelioma patients will offer a better look at how well immunotherapy works and what side effects it can cause. These drugs are being studied for mesothelioma now: Atezolizumab ( Tecentriq) Durvalumab ( Imfinzi) Ipilimumab ( Yervoy) Nivolumab ( Opdivo) Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) Tremelimumab How Does Immunotherapy Work? Unlike chemotherapy drugs, which kill both cancer and healthy cells, immunotherapy is more targeted. It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer. White blood cells in your immune system spot cells that aren't supposed to be in your body, like bacteria or viruses. Immunotherapy drugs tell the white blood cells to sense certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells, then seek out and destroy those cells. Block the Blocker It sounds simple, but in mesothelioma, these proteins can block your immune system's attack. They're called checkpoints. They distract your white blood cells so they don't attack the cancer inside. Checkpoint proteins include PD-1 and PD- L1. Immunotherapy drugs like atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab are called checkpoint inhibitors because they block the proteins' defense. Checkpoints normally act as an off switch for immune cells attacking tumor cells. Immunotherapy reveals the tumor cells. The checkpoint inhibitor pulls the mask off so the immune cells can do their job. When Is It Used? Mesothelioma is hard to treat because its tumor cells are high in checkpoints. So current trials test different mixes of immunotherapy drugs, as well as use of immunotherapy to rev up your immune system before cancer surgery. The results: People who've failed other treatments often respond well to immunotherapy. Right now, immunotherapy is mainly given to people with mesothelioma in clinical trials.. So how and when do you know if you should sign up for one? Every trial is different. Each has its own requirements for who can enroll based on the type of mesothelioma you have and what treatments you've already tried that didn't work. You and your doctor can talk about immunotherapy when you're diagnosed and go over your treatment options. The type of mesothelioma you have and how far it has spread will help you decide if you should try chemotherapy or surgery first. Usually, you go into a drug trial if other treatments have failed. But some mesothelioma immunotherapy trials don't require that. How Do You Take Immunotherapy? These drugs are all given as infusions, so you go to a clinic to get an IV drip every 2 to 3 weeks. Immunotherapy can cause side effects including diarrhea, nausea, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, and inflamed organs. Next Steps Researchers want to find biomarkers, like genes or those proteins on the tumors, that could help immunotherapy drugs better hit their targets. Also, most people don't respond to a single drug, so scientists are looking into combinations with surgery, other cancer drugs, and other immunotherapies. More trials on more patients with mesothelioma may tell us how well they work in different types of this cancer, and why they seem to work when other drugs have failed. Doctors will go back and figure out why people had the response they did, whether it was partial or very good. One day, you might not have to wait until other treatments fail first to try immunotherapy. If things keep going the way they are, it could soon become a front-line treatment for mesothelioma.", "question": "How does cancer immunotherapy work?", "answer": ["It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer.

How you treat the itching, though, depends a lot on the cause of the problem. It may just be dry skin, which can be brought on by winter weather or too much scrubbing. But sometimes, itchy hands and feet can signal another health condition. Could It Be Psoriasis? Psoriasis happens when skin cells grow too fast and then pile up on the skin's surface. It's a long-lasting condition that usually runs in families. There are a few different types, and itchiness of the palms and soles is a common symptom. If you have psoriasis, you may also have: Patches of red skin, bumps filled with puss, or silver scales Painful, swollen, or stiff joints Soreness of the affected area Itchiness in other places like your elbows, knees, lower back, and face Could It Be Eczema? Eczema is a term for a group of conditions that inflame the skin. There are several different types that can show up anywhere on the body. But one type, called dyshidrotic dermatitis, affects only the hands and feet. Besides the urge to scratch, symptoms of dyshidrotic dermatitis include: Clear blisters Red, cracked skin Scaly skin Could It Be Scabies? An eight-legged bug, called the human itch mite, is the source of this common skin condition. The tiny pest digs into the top layer of your skin and lays eggs there, causing scabies. The condition tends to spread in very crowded areas, where people have a lot of skin-to-skin contact that happens over a long time. You usually can't get scabies from quick touching, like a handshake or a hug. Itchy hands and feet are common in infants and young kids with scabies, but not adults. It also causes: Itchiness, especially at night, of the entire body or specific areas, like the wrist, elbow, armpit, and the webbing between fingers Pimply rash Tiny blisters and scales Sores Grayish-white or skin-colored âburrowsâ that look like lines Could It Be Diabetes? A skin problem is sometimes the first sign that you have diabetes. One of these skin conditions is eruptive xanthomatosis, which can make hands and feet itch. It's caused by out-of-control diabetes, and it goes away when the disease is managed well. It can also make you itchy on your arms, legs, and buttocks. Other signs of eruptive xanthomatosis: Small, yellow bumps on the skin Redness around the bumps High cholesterol Could It Be Allergies? Your skin can have an allergic reaction to something you touch. The response you see and feel is another type of eczema called allergic contact dermatitis. Symptoms may not appear for a few hours after you touch the item you're allergic to. When they do appear, you may feel itchy and have: Rash Very dry skin Burning and stinging Hives Blisters In general, the answer hinges on what's making your hands and feet itch. Ointments, creams, and lotions can help when dry skin is to blame. If those don't keep you from scratching, talk to your doctor to figure out what's right for you. An allergic reaction may need antihistamines or corticosteroids, whether over-the-counter or prescribed by your doctor. Some products treat scabies by killing the mites on your body.

Also, smoking greatly raises your chances for clogged arteries and vascular disease. If you have erectile dysfunction, it helps to kick the habit. Your penis must store blood to keep an erection. If the veins can't keep blood there during an erection, you'll lose it. This is called venous leak. It may happen with vascular disease.

This means you'll get more than one treatment at the same time to attack the cancer cells. Years ago, the main weapons that doctors used to fight cancer were surgery, chemotherapy (strong medicine that kills healthy cells along with cancer cells), and radiation. Today, there are many new tools, like immunotherapy, which boosts your body's own immune system to help it fight cancer, and targeted therapy, which targets and attacks certain mutated genes or proteins that are in some forms of cancer without harming normal cells. Often, when doctors combine two or more ways fight cancer, they have a greater result than when they use only one cancer-fighting weapon at a time. This type of treatment lets them attack cancer from many angles at the same time, so there are fewer places for it to hide. This makes it more likely that the treatments will help. Your doctor will decide what type is best for you based on your health and the type of melanoma you have. He'll also choose the best option to try first. Some treatments may never be right for you, if your form of melanoma doesn't have certain mutated genes or proteins. You may have more severe side effects than if you only got one treatment at a time. Your doctor may choose to stop one if the side effects are too severe. He may also stop a treatment if you don't improve by a certain time. Your doctor may suggest these combinations: Research has shown that using two drugs to treat stage IV melanoma works better than using just one. Cancer can trick your immune system into leaving it alone. These meds âwake upâ your body so you can fight back. When ipilimumab ( Yervoy) is paired with either nivolumab ( Opdivo) or pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) survival rates are better than treating with ipilimumab alone. Your doctor will know whether or not this drug combo is right for you. You could be more likely to have a serious heart problem or other severe side effects than if you only took one of the drugs. Some of today's newer cancer treatments target certain mutated genes or proteins that cancer needs to thrive or survive. If your melanoma has them, you can take a medication to attack them. About half the people with melanoma have a change to their genes called BRAF. Other people have a certain protein called MEK that helps melanoma grow and thrive. If your cancer has them, the doctor may give you a mix of binimetinib ( Mektovi) and encorafenib ( Braftovi), dabrafenib ( Tafinlar) and trametinib ( Mekinist) or two other drugs called cobimetinib ( Cotellic) andvemurafenib ( Zelboraf). They can shrink tumors and help you live longer. But there can be strong side effects. Chemotherapy isn't the first treatment choice for melanoma. But some patients with stage IV melanoma do get chemo drugs as a type of combination therapy. There are a number of drugs that your doctor can choose from, and it's likely that you'll receive more than one such drug at a time. This mix works well to shrink tumors, but it may also cause more side effects. Doctors are testing other forms of combination therapy for melanoma in clinical trials. Several treatments look like they may have promise. Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is right for you. These treatments may be available outside of clinical trials if they prove to be worthy: A combination of immunotherapy drugs for people who have less-advanced melanoma A combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for people with stage IV melanoma A combination of immunotherapy and radiation (which is called radioimmunotherapy) for people with melanoma. Right now, doctors use it to treat certain types of lymphoma, which is another form of cancer.

This type of treatment lets them attack cancer from many angles at the same time, so there are fewer places for it to hide. This makes it more likely that the treatments will help. Your doctor will decide what type is best for you based on your health and the type of melanoma you have. He'll also choose the best option to try first. Some treatments may never be right for you, if your form of melanoma doesn't have certain mutated genes or proteins. You may have more severe side effects than if you only got one treatment at a time. Your doctor may choose to stop one if the side effects are too severe. He may also stop a treatment if you don't improve by a certain time. Your doctor may suggest these combinations: Research has shown that using two drugs to treat stage IV melanoma works better than using just one. Cancer can trick your immune system into leaving it alone. These meds âwake upâ your body so you can fight back. When ipilimumab ( Yervoy) is paired with either nivolumab ( Opdivo) or pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) survival rates are better than treating with ipilimumab alone. Your doctor will know whether or not this drug combo is right for you. You could be more likely to have a serious heart problem or other severe side effects than if you only took one of the drugs. Some of today's newer cancer treatments target certain mutated genes or proteins that cancer needs to thrive or survive. If your melanoma has them, you can take a medication to attack them. About half the people with melanoma have a change to their genes called BRAF. Other people have a certain protein called MEK that helps melanoma grow and thrive. If your cancer has them, the doctor may give you a mix of binimetinib ( Mektovi) and encorafenib ( Braftovi), dabrafenib ( Tafinlar) and trametinib ( Mekinist) or two other drugs called cobimetinib ( Cotellic) andvemurafenib ( Zelboraf). They can shrink tumors and help you live longer. But there can be strong side effects. Chemotherapy isn't the first treatment choice for melanoma. But some patients with stage IV melanoma do get chemo drugs as a type of combination therapy. There are a number of drugs that your doctor can choose from, and it's likely that you'll receive more than one such drug at a time. This mix works well to shrink tumors, but it may also cause more side effects. Doctors are testing other forms of combination therapy for melanoma in clinical trials. Several treatments look like they may have promise. Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is right for you. These treatments may be available outside of clinical trials if they prove to be worthy: A combination of immunotherapy drugs for people who have less-advanced melanoma A combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for people with stage IV melanoma A combination of immunotherapy and radiation (which is called radioimmunotherapy) for people with melanoma. Right now, doctors use it to treat certain types of lymphoma, which is another form of cancer. A combination of immunotherapy and a cancer-fighting vaccine for people with melanoma", "question": "How can chemotherapy help treat melanoma?", "answer": ["Chemotherapy isn't the first treatment choice for melanoma.

Age plays a role, but the causes can include injures, an inactive lifestyle, poor posture, illnesses, and obesity, among many other things. If you're having pain, it's important to figure out why. Your back is at the mercy of bad habits like: Slouching at your desk Lifting and pulling heavy objects with your back rather your legs Being overweight Not exercising enough Smoking Wearing high heels Carrying an overloaded backpack All of these things can lead to lower back pain. You may carry your stress in your back -- the muscles feel like they're in knots. And the pain can feel much worse if you're also depressed or anxious. Falling down, getting into a car accident, or even overdoing it in that pick-up game over the weekend can cause problems you feel in your lower back, like: Spine/vertebral fractures: Your back may have a broken bone if it gets hit hard or you fall from a great height. Sprains and strains: Lifting and twisting at the same time, or swinging a golf club, can pull or tear the ligaments, muscles, and tendons in your back. Spasms: These are muscle contractions, and they hurt. They generally happen when you sprain or strain your lower back. In many cases, the pain happens when parts of the back -- the spine, joints, tissues, muscles, and the discs that cushion the spinal bones (vertebrae) -- are out of sync. If your back isn't feeling quite right, have your doctor check for: Herniated or slipped discs: The bones of your spine are cushioned by discs, often referred to as âshock absorbers.â When they wear down, the soft tissue between them begins to squeeze out. This is when you start to feel it -- especially if they rupture. It can happen if you've had a sudden injury, or because of simple wear and tear. Bulging discs: The stuff inside your discs âbulges,â but not as much as with a herniated disc. They often cause no symptoms on their own, but they can bring pain if the disc pushes up against a nerve root. Degenerative disc disease: The discs that separate your vertebrae wear down. This sometimes causes the bones to rub together. Age is usually the reason, but sports and injuries can be culprits, too. Inflammation and movement problems of the sacroiliac joint: This joint sits at the bottom of the spine, on either side of the pelvis. It transfers the weight of your upper body to your lower body. This can start to bother you after you've been injured, if you have an infection, if you have arthritis, or if you're pregnant. Abnormal movement, such as too much movement of the joint, can also cause long-term pain. Lumbar spinal stenosis : If you're over age 60, there's a decent chance this is your culprit. As you age, your spinal canal narrows. That change can put pressure on the nerves running through your spine. Your shoulders and legs will then start to feel numb. Cauda equina syndrome: This happens if a ruptured disc pushes down into the nerve roots in your spine. It may be what's causing your pain if bladder and bowel control have been an issue for you lately. Cervical radiculopathy : This is a pinched nerve in your neck that is usually caused by a bone spur or herniated disc. Sciatica: This may be your cause if you have a sharp pain in your lower back or hip. It happens when a herniated disc presses on the nerves in your lower spine. Arthritis: This causes stiffness, swelling, and inflammation in your joints. If your doctor mentions âankylosing spondylitis,â he's talking about a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the joints and ligaments along your spine. Osteoarthritis : This is when your cartilage and bone begin to break down and there is inflammation. Scoliosis: You may hear this called âcurvature of the spine.â If you have it, chances are you were born with it. Pain tied to it usually starts at about middle age. Spondylolisthesis: If your doctor mentions this, a bone in the spine has slipped out of place, probably in your lower back. This can be seen by X-ray or MRI. Spinal stenosis: This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that causes pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. It's usually from arthritis or bony growth from wear and tear. Lower back pain can also be caused by other things that are going on in your body. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: If the blood vessel that supplies blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs is at risk of rupturing, you'll feel sudden pain in your lower back. Pregnancy: All that weight out front can put a real strain on your back. Tumors: They usually don't start in the back, but are part of the spread of a cancer in the spine that started somewhere else in your body. Infections: Osteomyelitis, discitis and, septic sacroiliitis are uncommon infections that affect the bones, discs, and joints of the spine. Any one of these can cause pain in your lower back.

This is when you start to feel it -- especially if they rupture. It can happen if you've had a sudden injury, or because of simple wear and tear. Bulging discs: The stuff inside your discs âbulges,â but not as much as with a herniated disc. They often cause no symptoms on their own, but they can bring pain if the disc pushes up against a nerve root. Degenerative disc disease: The discs that separate your vertebrae wear down. This sometimes causes the bones to rub together. Age is usually the reason, but sports and injuries can be culprits, too. Inflammation and movement problems of the sacroiliac joint: This joint sits at the bottom of the spine, on either side of the pelvis. It transfers the weight of your upper body to your lower body. This can start to bother you after you've been injured, if you have an infection, if you have arthritis, or if you're pregnant. Abnormal movement, such as too much movement of the joint, can also cause long-term pain. Lumbar spinal stenosis : If you're over age 60, there's a decent chance this is your culprit. As you age, your spinal canal narrows. That change can put pressure on the nerves running through your spine. Your shoulders and legs will then start to feel numb. Cauda equina syndrome: This happens if a ruptured disc pushes down into the nerve roots in your spine. It may be what's causing your pain if bladder and bowel control have been an issue for you lately. Cervical radiculopathy : This is a pinched nerve in your neck that is usually caused by a bone spur or herniated disc. Sciatica: This may be your cause if you have a sharp pain in your lower back or hip. It happens when a herniated disc presses on the nerves in your lower spine. Arthritis: This causes stiffness, swelling, and inflammation in your joints. If your doctor mentions âankylosing spondylitis,â he's talking about a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the joints and ligaments along your spine. Osteoarthritis : This is when your cartilage and bone begin to break down and there is inflammation. Scoliosis: You may hear this called âcurvature of the spine.â If you have it, chances are you were born with it. Pain tied to it usually starts at about middle age. Spondylolisthesis: If your doctor mentions this, a bone in the spine has slipped out of place, probably in your lower back. This can be seen by X-ray or MRI. Spinal stenosis: This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that causes pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. It's usually from arthritis or bony growth from wear and tear. Lower back pain can also be caused by other things that are going on in your body. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: If the blood vessel that supplies blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs is at risk of rupturing, you'll feel sudden pain in your lower back. Pregnancy: All that weight out front can put a real strain on your back. Tumors: They usually don't start in the back, but are part of the spread of a cancer in the spine that started somewhere else in your body. Infections: Osteomyelitis, discitis and, septic sacroiliitis are uncommon infections that affect the bones, discs, and joints of the spine. Any one of these can cause pain in your lower back.

They make it hard for your child's body to remove waste products as he digests proteins. They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child. In most cases, you can manage them with diet and medications. When your baby eats protein, his body breaks it down into amino acids and uses what he needs. What he doesn't need is further broken down into waste products that his body removes. This happens in a process called the urea cycle. Your baby's liver makes things called enzymes that turn waste nitrogen into urea. The urea leaves his body in his urine. If your child has a urea cycle disorder, his liver can't make one of the enzymes the cycle needs. When his body can't remove nitrogen, ammonia forms and collects in his blood. It's toxic and can cause brain damage or put him in a coma. It can even be fatal if you don't treat it quickly. UCDs affect about 1 in 30,000-35,000 newborns. There are eight types. They're named after what's missing from the urea cycle. You'll also hear doctors call them by their initials: ARG1 deficiency -- Arginase ASL deficiency -- Argininosuccinate lyase ASS1 deficiency -- Argininosuccinate synthase 1 Citrin deficiency -- Citrin CPSI deficiency -- Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I NAGS deficiency -- N-acetylglutamate synthase ORNT1 deficiency -- Ornithine translocase OTC deficiency -- Ornithine transcarbamylase Parents pass these diseases down to their children through defective genes. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child's body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome, and they mostly pass it to their sons. UCDs fall into two groups: Complete UCD: This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You'll notice symptoms in the first couple of days: Fussy Sleepy or sluggish Can't feed Vomits Low body temperature Problems with posture Seizures Fast breathing that becomes slow Coma Partial UCD: Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as he needs. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years. A buildup of ammonia (you may hear the doctor call it hyperammonemia) can happen from illness, injury, stress, or quick weight loss. Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include: Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Behavior problems, including hyperactivity Mental problems (confusion, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis) Most newborns in the U. S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies. If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam. They'll ask about your family history and do tests. They'll look for ammonia in your child's blood and amino acid in his blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of his liver through a process called biopsy. They'll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis. UCDs are life-threatening. Don't wait to get treatment. A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time: Dialysis to remove ammonia from his blood Feeding him supplements of sugars, fats, and amino acids Medicines to remove extra nitrogen Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout his life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on his body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause his levels to rise. During those times, you'll need to give him extra calories so his body has plenty of fuel. Long-term treatment will include: A low protein, high-calorie diet Medications to remove nitrogen Supplements of amino acids Drinking plenty of water A liver transplant can reverse the symptoms of a urea cycle disorder. There's no cure for UCDs. Your child's long-term health depends on which UCD he has, how severe it is, how early it was diagnosed, and how closely you follow the treatment plan. If your child doesn't follow the special diet or he has frequent stress-induced symptoms, repeated brain swelling can lead to irreversible brain damage. If he's diagnosed early and follows his diet, he can live a normal life.", "question": "What are symptoms of complete urea cycle disorders (UCDs)?", "answer": ["Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD.

If your child has a urea cycle disorder, his liver can't make one of the enzymes the cycle needs. When his body can't remove nitrogen, ammonia forms and collects in his blood. It's toxic and can cause brain damage or put him in a coma. It can even be fatal if you don't treat it quickly. UCDs affect about 1 in 30,000-35,000 newborns. There are eight types. They're named after what's missing from the urea cycle. You'll also hear doctors call them by their initials: ARG1 deficiency -- Arginase ASL deficiency -- Argininosuccinate lyase ASS1 deficiency -- Argininosuccinate synthase 1 Citrin deficiency -- Citrin CPSI deficiency -- Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I NAGS deficiency -- N-acetylglutamate synthase ORNT1 deficiency -- Ornithine translocase OTC deficiency -- Ornithine transcarbamylase Parents pass these diseases down to their children through defective genes. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child's body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome, and they mostly pass it to their sons. UCDs fall into two groups: Complete UCD: This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You'll notice symptoms in the first couple of days: Fussy Sleepy or sluggish Can't feed Vomits Low body temperature Problems with posture Seizures Fast breathing that becomes slow Coma Partial UCD: Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as he needs. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years. A buildup of ammonia (you may hear the doctor call it hyperammonemia) can happen from illness, injury, stress, or quick weight loss. Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include: Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Behavior problems, including hyperactivity Mental problems (confusion, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis) Most newborns in the U. S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies. If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam. They'll ask about your family history and do tests. They'll look for ammonia in your child's blood and amino acid in his blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of his liver through a process called biopsy. They'll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis. UCDs are life-threatening. Don't wait to get treatment. A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time: Dialysis to remove ammonia from his blood Feeding him supplements of sugars, fats, and amino acids Medicines to remove extra nitrogen Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout his life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on his body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause his levels to rise. During those times, you'll need to give him extra calories so his body has plenty of fuel. Long-term treatment will include: A low protein, high-calorie diet Medications to remove nitrogen Supplements of amino acids Drinking plenty of water A liver transplant can reverse the symptoms of a urea cycle disorder. There's no cure for UCDs. Your child's long-term health depends on which UCD he has, how severe it is, how early it was diagnosed, and how closely you follow the treatment plan. If your child doesn't follow the special diet or he has frequent stress-induced symptoms, repeated brain swelling can lead to irreversible brain damage.

They make it hard for your child's body to remove waste products as he digests proteins. They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child.

They stop abnormal electrical signals that move through your heart and cause an irregular heartbeat (the doctor might call it arrhythmia). Cardiac ablation can also treat atrial fibrillation ( AFib), also a type of irregular heartbeat. The doctor may try cardiac ablation if medications and resetting your heartbeat -- he'll probably refer to it as cardioversion -- don't work. Catheter ablation, also called radiofrequency or pulmonary vein ablation, isn't surgery, and it's the least invasive option. Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into a blood vessel in your leg or neck. Then, it's guided to your heart. When it reaches the area that's causing the arrhythmia, It sends out electrical signals that destroy those cells. The treated tissue helps get your heartbeat regular again. There are two main types: Radiofrequency ablation: The doctor uses catheters to send radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) that creates circular scars around each vein or group of veins. Cryoablation: A single catheter sends a balloon tipped with a substance that freezes the tissues to cause a scar. Surgical ablation involves cutting into your chest. There are three kinds: Maze procedure: This is usually done while you're having open-heart surgery for another problem, like a bypass or valve replacement. The surgeon makes small cuts in the upper part of the heart. They're stitched together to form the scar tissue that stops abnormal signals. Mini maze: Most people with AFib don't need open-heart surgery. That's where this less invasive option comes in. The doctor makes several small cuts between your ribs and uses a camera to guide catheters for either cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation. Some hospitals offer robotic-assisted surgery that uses smaller cuts and makes the procedure more precise. Your doctor will put a video camera or tiny robot into your chest. It'll guide the creation of scar tissue that may help keep your heartbeat at the right pace. Convergent procedure: This pairs catheter ablation with a mini maze. The doctor uses radiofrequency ablation in the pulmonary vein, and a surgeon makes a small cut under your breastbone to use radiofrequency energy on the outside of your heart. You and your doctor will talk about AFib treatment options, including ablation. The plan will depend on: The cause of your AFib Whether you have symptoms Your chance of having heart disease Different types of ablation target different parts of your heart. You may be able to go home the same day, or you may need to stay a night or longer in the hospital. Drugs can treat the AFib and keep your heart at a regular rhythm, but they may cause side effects or stop working. Cardiac ablation might be the next option. It can provide a treatment that lasts longer or cures the AFib. Nonsurgical and less invasive ablation are successful for many people with AFib. If the first procedure is not successful, often a second will be. With those options, you'll be able to recover and get back to your normal routine quickly. More than likely you'll need to: Stop eating or drinking the night before the procedure. Stop taking medications to treat arrhythmia several days before. Ask the doctor if you should stop any other medications. Ask the doctor about precautions if you have a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator. The doctor will provide any other special instructions. If you don't treat AFib, your odds of getting blood clots, heart failure, or stroke go up. These could be life-threatening. The doctor will take your risk factors into account before he suggests a treatment. If you have no symptoms, or they're mild, he may watch and wait. But he might prescribe warfarin or another blood thinner to protect you from strokes. Cardiac ablation may be right for you if AFib symptoms are more severe and make it hard to do daily tasks It depends on what type of procedure you have: Catheter ablation: You may need to spend a night in the hospital, but most people go home the same day. If so, you'll rest in a recovery room for a few hours while a nurse closely watches your heart rate and blood pressure. You need to lie flat and still to prevent bleeding from where your skin was cut. Plan to have someone drive you. The doctor will prescribe a medication to prevent blood clots and another to prevent AFib. You'll probably take them for 2 months. A shower is OK once you're home, but keep the water on the cooler side. Don't take a bath, swim, or soak for 5 days or until the cuts have healed. For the first week: Don't lift more than 10 pounds. Skip activities that make you push or pull heavy things -- don't shovel show or mow the lawn. If you get tired, stop and rest. Don't exercise -- you can go back to normal in week two. Maze procedure: You'll probably be in the hospital about a week. You'll spend the first couple of days in an intensive care unit ( ICU), then move to a regular room before you go home. Full recovery takes about 6-8 weeks, but you should be able to return to normal activities within 2-3 weeks. You should start to feel better in about 4 weeks. You'll probably take a blood thinner for about 3 months. Mini maze: You'll be in the ICU for a few hours to a day. You'll probably stay for 2-4 days total. Open-heart maze: This is major surgery. You'll spend a day or two in intensive care, and you may be in the hospital up to a week. At first, you'll feel very tired and have some chest pain. You can probably go back to work in about 3 months, but it may take 6 months to get back to normal. Once you're home: You may need someone to drive you for a while -- the doctor will tell you when you can drive again. You'll probably need help at home. You'll need to go back in about 10 days to get stitches out. Don't lift anything heavy for several weeks. Convergent procedure: Usually requires a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. Recovery is similar to catheter ablation. Any procedure has risks. Problems with cardiac ablation can include: Bleeding or infection where the catheter went in Damaged blood vessels if the catheter scrapes them on its way through Arrhythmias caused by damage to your heart's electrical system Blood clots in your legs or lungs Heart damage, like punctures or damaged valves Stroke or heart attack Narrowing of the veins between your lungs and heart Kidney damage from the dye Radiation Death Catheter ablation may not cure your AFib, but it will often relieve your symptoms. You could still have AFib episodes during the first 3 months, because that's how long it takes for the scars to form. If you've had AFib a long time, you'll likely need a repeat treatment to keep your heartbeat normal. You may also need medicine to control your heart rhythm for a few months after the procedure. Most people who have the maze procedure get long-term relief from their symptoms.

Drugs can treat the AFib and keep your heart at a regular rhythm, but they may cause side effects or stop working. Cardiac ablation might be the next option. It can provide a treatment that lasts longer or cures the AFib. Nonsurgical and less invasive ablation are successful for many people with AFib. If the first procedure is not successful, often a second will be. With those options, you'll be able to recover and get back to your normal routine quickly. More than likely you'll need to: Stop eating or drinking the night before the procedure. Stop taking medications to treat arrhythmia several days before. Ask the doctor if you should stop any other medications. Ask the doctor about precautions if you have a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator. The doctor will provide any other special instructions. If you don't treat AFib, your odds of getting blood clots, heart failure, or stroke go up. These could be life-threatening. The doctor will take your risk factors into account before he suggests a treatment. If you have no symptoms, or they're mild, he may watch and wait. But he might prescribe warfarin or another blood thinner to protect you from strokes. Cardiac ablation may be right for you if AFib symptoms are more severe and make it hard to do daily tasks It depends on what type of procedure you have: Catheter ablation: You may need to spend a night in the hospital, but most people go home the same day. If so, you'll rest in a recovery room for a few hours while a nurse closely watches your heart rate and blood pressure. You need to lie flat and still to prevent bleeding from where your skin was cut. Plan to have someone drive you. The doctor will prescribe a medication to prevent blood clots and another to prevent AFib. You'll probably take them for 2 months. A shower is OK once you're home, but keep the water on the cooler side. Don't take a bath, swim, or soak for 5 days or until the cuts have healed. For the first week: Don't lift more than 10 pounds. Skip activities that make you push or pull heavy things -- don't shovel show or mow the lawn. If you get tired, stop and rest. Don't exercise -- you can go back to normal in week two. Maze procedure: You'll probably be in the hospital about a week. You'll spend the first couple of days in an intensive care unit ( ICU), then move to a regular room before you go home. Full recovery takes about 6-8 weeks, but you should be able to return to normal activities within 2-3 weeks. You should start to feel better in about 4 weeks. You'll probably take a blood thinner for about 3 months. Mini maze: You'll be in the ICU for a few hours to a day. You'll probably stay for 2-4 days total. Open-heart maze: This is major surgery. You'll spend a day or two in intensive care, and you may be in the hospital up to a week. At first, you'll feel very tired and have some chest pain. You can probably go back to work in about 3 months, but it may take 6 months to get back to normal. Once you're home: You may need someone to drive you for a while -- the doctor will tell you when you can drive again. You'll probably need help at home. You'll need to go back in about 10 days to get stitches out. Don't lift anything heavy for several weeks. Convergent procedure: Usually requires a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. Recovery is similar to catheter ablation. Any procedure has risks. Problems with cardiac ablation can include: Bleeding or infection where the catheter went in Damaged blood vessels if the catheter scrapes them on its way through Arrhythmias caused by damage to your heart's electrical system Blood clots in your legs or lungs Heart damage, like punctures or damaged valves Stroke or heart attack Narrowing of the veins between your lungs and heart Kidney damage from the dye Radiation Death Catheter ablation may not cure your AFib, but it will often relieve your symptoms. You could still have AFib episodes during the first 3 months, because that's how long it takes for the scars to form. If you've had AFib a long time, you'll likely need a repeat treatment to keep your heartbeat normal. You may also need medicine to control your heart rhythm for a few months after the procedure. Most people who have the maze procedure get long-term relief from their symptoms.

They stop abnormal electrical signals that move through your heart and cause an irregular heartbeat (the doctor might call it arrhythmia). Cardiac ablation can also treat atrial fibrillation ( AFib), also a type of irregular heartbeat. The doctor may try cardiac ablation if medications and resetting your heartbeat -- he'll probably refer to it as cardioversion -- don't work. Catheter ablation, also called radiofrequency or pulmonary vein ablation, isn't surgery, and it's the least invasive option. Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into a blood vessel in your leg or neck. Then, it's guided to your heart. When it reaches the area that's causing the arrhythmia, It sends out electrical signals that destroy those cells. The treated tissue helps get your heartbeat regular again. There are two main types: Radiofrequency ablation: The doctor uses catheters to send radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) that creates circular scars around each vein or group of veins. Cryoablation: A single catheter sends a balloon tipped with a substance that freezes the tissues to cause a scar. Surgical ablation involves cutting into your chest. There are three kinds: Maze procedure: This is usually done while you're having open-heart surgery for another problem, like a bypass or valve replacement. The surgeon makes small cuts in the upper part of the heart. They're stitched together to form the scar tissue that stops abnormal signals. Mini maze: Most people with AFib don't need open-heart surgery. That's where this less invasive option comes in. The doctor makes several small cuts between your ribs and uses a camera to guide catheters for either cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation. Some hospitals offer robotic-assisted surgery that uses smaller cuts and makes the procedure more precise. Your doctor will put a video camera or tiny robot into your chest. It'll guide the creation of scar tissue that may help keep your heartbeat at the right pace. Convergent procedure: This pairs catheter ablation with a mini maze. The doctor uses radiofrequency ablation in the pulmonary vein, and a surgeon makes a small cut under your breastbone to use radiofrequency energy on the outside of your heart.

These include medications to help ease pain and inflammation and surgeries to help you move better. Your goal is to manage your AS so you can live an active life. Your first step to treat AS will be to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs). They help relieve your inflammation, pain, stiffness, and swelling. Still, NSAIDs do not treat the problems with your immune system when you have AS. These problems cause damage to your joints and bones. NSAIDs used to treat AS pain and stiffness include: Celecoxib ( Celebrex) Diclofenac Ibuprofen Indomethacin Meloxicam ( Mobic) Naproxen You can get most NSAIDs in generic forms. Some, like ibuprofen and naproxen, are sold over the counter in drugstores. Unfortunately, NSAIDs can break down the barriers that protect your stomach. This can cause an upset stomach and heartburn. In time, NSAIDs can cause ulcers even if you don't have symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine to protect your stomach. Celecoxib is an NSAID that may ease inflammation without hurting your stomach. If NSAIDs don't ease your AS symptoms, your doctor may prescribe stronger drugs called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs). They affect your immune system and can help curb inflammation. They may help with the arthritis that can damage your back and other joints. They also may ease symptoms like joint pain and swelling. DMARDs don't work very well for inflammation in the spine. DMARDs used to treat AS include: Methotrexate Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) Methotrexate comes in both pills and shots you can give yourself at home. You may take folic acid supplements to help ease side effects like mouth sores or nausea. Methotrexate can affect your liver, so your doctor will test your blood to make sure your liver is healthy. Sulfasalazine is available as pills. You may have side effects like headaches, bloating, nausea, or mouth ulcers. Your doctor will test your blood from time to time to watch for side effects. If you have severe inflammation in a joint (called a flare), your doctor may give you a shot of corticosteroid in that spot. These drugs are also called steroids. A steroid shot may give you short-term relief from pain and swelling in your joint. Your doctor can inject steroids into the joints, including your sacroiliac (where your lower back meets your pelvis), knee, or hip joint. While these can help, you don't want to rely on them as your main treatment. If NSAIDs or DMARDs don't control your AS, your doctor may prescribe drugs called biologics. These drugs aim to fix the problems with your immune system. They target your body's production of specific proteins that cause inflammation. Biologic drugs affect your immune system and can help ease AS symptoms (pain, swelling, tenderness, and stiffness) as well as inflammation. These drugs may also help protect your joints from damage. You have a higher chance of getting infections like tuberculosis when you take biologics. If you have signs of an infection, such as a fever or congestion, you should tell your doctor. Your doctor will test you for tuberculosis before you start a biologic drug and while you take it. These drugs also may raise your odds of getting certain types of cancer, but this is rare. Biologic drugs used to treat AS include: Adalimumab ( Humira) Certolizumab ( Cimzia) Etanercept ( Enbrel) Golimumab ( Simponi) Infliximab ( Remicade) Secukinumab ( Cosentyx) There is research going on now to find new treatments for AS. Some studies focus on genes, including HLA- B27, that make you more likely to get the disease. Others focus on proteins that may trigger inflammation.

Celecoxib is an NSAID that may ease inflammation without hurting your stomach. If NSAIDs don't ease your AS symptoms, your doctor may prescribe stronger drugs called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs). They affect your immune system and can help curb inflammation. They may help with the arthritis that can damage your back and other joints. They also may ease symptoms like joint pain and swelling. DMARDs don't work very well for inflammation in the spine. DMARDs used to treat AS include: Methotrexate Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) Methotrexate comes in both pills and shots you can give yourself at home. You may take folic acid supplements to help ease side effects like mouth sores or nausea. Methotrexate can affect your liver, so your doctor will test your blood to make sure your liver is healthy. Sulfasalazine is available as pills. You may have side effects like headaches, bloating, nausea, or mouth ulcers. Your doctor will test your blood from time to time to watch for side effects. If you have severe inflammation in a joint (called a flare), your doctor may give you a shot of corticosteroid in that spot. These drugs are also called steroids. A steroid shot may give you short-term relief from pain and swelling in your joint. Your doctor can inject steroids into the joints, including your sacroiliac (where your lower back meets your pelvis), knee, or hip joint. While these can help, you don't want to rely on them as your main treatment. If NSAIDs or DMARDs don't control your AS, your doctor may prescribe drugs called biologics. These drugs aim to fix the problems with your immune system. They target your body's production of specific proteins that cause inflammation. Biologic drugs affect your immune system and can help ease AS symptoms (pain, swelling, tenderness, and stiffness) as well as inflammation. These drugs may also help protect your joints from damage. You have a higher chance of getting infections like tuberculosis when you take biologics. If you have signs of an infection, such as a fever or congestion, you should tell your doctor. Your doctor will test you for tuberculosis before you start a biologic drug and while you take it. These drugs also may raise your odds of getting certain types of cancer, but this is rare. Biologic drugs used to treat AS include: Adalimumab ( Humira) Certolizumab ( Cimzia) Etanercept ( Enbrel) Golimumab ( Simponi) Infliximab ( Remicade) Secukinumab ( Cosentyx) There is research going on now to find new treatments for AS. Some studies focus on genes, including HLA- B27, that make you more likely to get the disease. Others focus on proteins that may trigger inflammation. Researchers hope to come up with new drugs to stop AS before it can damage your back and other joints. Treating the causes of your AS inflammation should help ease your pain. Talk with your doctor about specific pain medications, back stretches, and posture exercises.", "question": "How do DMARDs treat anklyosing spondilitis?", "answer": ["They affect your immune system and can help curb inflammation.

Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it's not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood.

On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix).

Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it's not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications.

To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood. Limiting how much sodium you eat can also help.", "question": "What medications can cause edema?", "answer": ["Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema."]}

Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it's not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema.

The lab will then send results to your doctor within 2 weeks. What Does the Test Do? It determines if there's blood in your stool -- a common sign of colon cancer or of precancerous polyps (abnormal growths of tissue). The lab workers will also look for DNA cell changes linked to cancer. Colon cancer is preventable if pre-cancerous polyps are found and removed. Should I Take It? Men and women 45 or older need to ask their doctor what type of screening test is right for them. You should get a colonoscopy test if you have any of these risk factors: A family history of colon cancer A previous diagnosis Related diseases of the colon and rectum During a colonoscopy, your doctor will use a flexible tube and small camera to look at the lining of your colon.

Cologuard, like other screening methods, can give incorrect results. It can indicate that you have colon cancer or precancerous polyps when you actually don't. Or it can say you don't have a potential problem when you really do, and the test just missed it. A colonoscopy can miss polyps, but the odds are very low.

He or she may ask questions about how you would describe your pain, when the pain occurs, or whether anything specific triggers the pain. The doctor will also ask about your risk factors for neuropathic pain and may also request both blood and nerve tests. Anticonvulsant and antidepressant drugs are often the first line of treatment. Some neuropathic pain studies suggest the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), such as Aleve or Motrin, may ease pain. Some people may require a stronger painkiller. Be sure to discuss the pros and cons of the medicine you take with your doctor. If another condition, such as diabetes, is involved, better management of that disorder may alleviate the pain. Effective management of the condition can also help prevent further nerve damage. In cases that are difficult to treat, a pain specialist may use an invasive or implantable device to effectively manage the pain. Electrical stimulation of the nerves involved in neuropathic pain may significantly control the pain symptoms. Other kinds of treatments can also help with neuropathic pain. Some of these include: Physical therapy Working with a counselor Relaxation therapy Massage therapy Acupuncture Unfortunately, neuropathic pain often responds poorly to standard pain treatments and occasionally may get worse instead of better over time. For some people, it can lead to serious disability.

They're using a specific medical term -- obesity -- to talk with you about your weight. The word \"obesity\" means too much body fat. It's usually based on your body mass index ( BMI), which you can check using a BMI calculator. BMI compares your weight to your height. If your BMI is 25 to 29.9, you're overweight but not obese. A BMI of 30 or more is in the obese range. Obesity can help explain some conditions you may have, such as: High blood pressure Heart disease and stroke Type 2 diabetes High cholesterol Joint problems caused by extra weight Trouble breathing, including sleep apnea, in which you briefly stop breathing while you're asleep Gallstones The good news is that you can take steps to lose weight. And losing even some weight can make a big difference to your health and how you feel. You may not have to lose as much as you might think in order to start seeing health benefits. As a start, aim to lose 1-2 pounds a week. Adults who are overweight or obese should try to lose 5% to 10% of their current weight over 6 months, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. If you're ready to get started with a weight loss program, ask your doctor to help you set personal goals and refer you to other professionals who can give you tips and help you reach your goals. For example, a nutritionist can help you with a food plan, and a physical therapist or trainer can help you move more. You'll want to go for steady progress over time, and to make lifestyle changes that work for you for the long run. That way you can start losing weight and feel better.", "question": "How can obesity affect your health?", "answer": ["Obesity can help explain some conditions you may have, such as: High blood pressure Heart disease and stroke Type 2 diabetes High cholesterol Joint problems caused by extra weight Trouble breathing, including sleep apnea, in which you briefly stop breathing while you're asleep Gallstones The good news is that you can take steps to lose weight."]}

Imagine a piece of silk. Just one small tear can make a big difference in how it looks. And it's the same with skin. Any burn, injury, or other trauma, such as surgery, can cause a scar. Now a scar isn't bad if it's small or in a location that's easy to conceal. But when it's not, you may wonder if there's a way to treat it, other than hiding it under your clothes, that will make it go away or at least change how it looks. The truth is the scar will never completely go away. But there are some methods that can help reduce its size and change its appearance. Scarring is a natural part of the healing process after an injury. Its appearance and its treatment depend on multiple factors. The depth and size of the wound or cut and the location of the injury matter. So do your age, genes, sex, and ethnicity. These are several different types of scars including: Keloid scars. These scars are the result of an overly aggressive healing process. They extend beyond the original injury. Over time, a keloid scar may hamper movement. Treatments include surgery to remove the scar, steroid injections, or silicone sheets to flatten the scar. Smaller keloids can be treated using cryotherapy (freezing therapy using liquid nitrogen). You can also prevent keloid formation by using pressure treatment or gel pads with silicone when you are injured. Keloid scars are most common among people with dark skin. Contracture scars. If your skin has been burned, you may have a contracture scar. These scars tighten skin, which can impair your ability to move. Contracture scars may also go deeper, affecting muscles and nerves. Hypertrophic scars. These are raised, red scars that are similar to keloids but do not go beyond the boundary of the injury. Treatments include injections of steroids to reduce inflammation or silicone sheets, which flatten the scar. Acne scars. If you've had severe acne, you probably have the scars to prove it. There are many types of acne scars, ranging from deep pits to scars that are angular or wavelike in appearance. Treatment options depend on the types of acne scars you have. Scar treatments may include: Over-the-counter or prescription creams, ointments, or gels. These products can be used to treat scars that are caused by cuts or other injuries or wounds. If you are under the care of a plastic surgeon and your scarring is from cosmetic or plastic surgery, ask your surgeon if over-the-counter treatment is an option. If not, there are prescriptions that may help. Often, treatments can include steroids or certain oral antihistamines for scars that cause itching and are very sensitive. Likewise, if you have scarring from severe acne, ask your dermatologist for advice. Your doctor can also recommend or use pressure treatment or silicone gel sheeting to help treat scars or as preventive care. Surgical removal or treatment. There are many options to treat deeper scars depending on your particular case. These include skin grafts, excision, dermabrasion, or laser surgery. In a skin graft, the surgeon uses skin from another area of your body. This is often used with people who've had burns. If you've got scarring that impairs function, surgery can help address the functional problems. If you've recently had surgery that has caused scars, it is best to wait at least one year before making a decision about scar treatment. Many scars fade and become less noticeable over time. Injections. You may get steroid injections to treat scars that stick out, such as keloids or hypertrophic scars. Your doctor may use this on its own or with other treatments. Other types of injections, such as collagen or other \"fillers,\" may be useful for some types of pitted scarring, although these are not usually permanent solutions. If your scar physically impairs you in any way, you may be able to get coverage from your health insurer. Ask your doctor to write a letter detailing your particular case.

Because it's hard to treat, MRSA is sometimes called a \"super bug.\" Garden-variety staph are common bacteria that can live in our bodies. Plenty of healthy people carry staph without being infected by it. In fact, one third of everybody has staph bacteria in their noses. But staph can be a problem if it manages to get into the body, often through a cut. Once there, it can cause an infection. Staph is one of the most common causes of skin infections in the U. S. Usually, these are minor and don't need special treatment. Less often, staph can cause serious problems like infected wounds or pneumonia. Staph can usually be treated with antibiotics. But over the decades, some strains of staph -- like MRSA -- have become resistant to antibiotics that once destroyed it. MRSA was first discovered in 1961. It's now resistant to methicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, oxacillin, and other common antibiotics known as cephalosporins. While some antibiotics still work, MRSA is constantly adapting. Researchers developing new antibiotics are having a tough time keeping up. MRSA is spread by contact. So, you could get MRSA by touching another person who has it on the skin. Or you could get it by touching objects that have the bacteria on them. MRSA is carried by about 2% of the population (or 2 in 100 people), although most of them aren't infected. There are two different populations of people who get MRSA -- one is in decline -- those who get it in hospitals or other health care environments -- and the other is on the rise -- those who get it in the community. MRSA infections are common among people who have weak immune systems who are in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care centers. Infections can appear around surgical wounds or invasive devices, like catheters or implanted feeding tubes. According to the CDC, invasive MRSA infections that began in hospitals declined 8% between 2011 and 2013. Community- Associated MRSA ( CA- MRSA) Alarmingly, MRSA is also showing up in healthy people who have not been hospitalized. This type of MRSA is called community-associated MRSA, or CA- MRSA. CA- MRSA skin infections have been identified among certain populations that share close quarters or have more skin-to-skin contact. Examples are team athletes, military recruits, prison inmates, and children in daycare. But more and more CA- MRSA infections are being seen in the general community, especially in certain geographic regions. CA- MRSA is also more likely to affect younger people.

With farmer's lung, the inflammation, or swelling, is in your lungs. Farmer's lung can cause three kinds of allergic reactions. An acute attack is an intense reaction that happens 4 to 8 hours after you breathe in mold. Symptoms include: Dry irritating cough Fever and chills Rapid breathing Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Sudden feeling that you're sick A sub-acute attack is less intense and comes on more slowly than an acute attack. Symptoms include: Achy muscles and joints Coughing Mild fever with some chills No appetite Shortness of breath Weight loss You may mistake acute or sub-acute farmer's lung for the flu, because many of the symptoms are the same. Chronic farmer's lung happens after you've had many acute attacks and are around large amounts of moldy dust often. When you reach this point, your lungs may have permanent damage. Symptoms include: Cough that won't go away Depression General aches and pains Night sweats No appetite and gradual weight loss Occasional fever Shortness of breath that gets worse over time Weakness and loss of energy Most people with acute or subacute farmer's lung get better; only a small percentage of people develop chronic farmer's lung. Farmers may notice that their symptoms get worse in the winter. Storing animal feed like hay, grass, or grain inside makes mold more likely to grow. Plus, there's no breeze or wind to clear it out of the air. It's common for farmers to get this disease from moldy hay and other crops. But you also can get it from dust in things like: Animal dander Bacteria Bark Bird droppings Dried rat urine Feathers Fungi Husks Insects Wood These allergens have to be very small -- around 5 millionths of a meter (5 microns) -- to affect you. Because the particles are so tiny, the normal defenses in your nose and throat miss them, and they go straight to your lungs. Your lungs then try to get rid of the dust, and your symptoms start when your immune system reacts to that. The most important questions your doctor will ask you will be about your environment. If you're not a farmer, it may be harder to figure out that farmer's lung is causing your symptoms. It can also be hard to know what's going on if you're not having an acute attack. Your doctor can give you a blood test to look for certain things that trigger your immune system (called antigens) or order a chest X-ray to look for signs that you've had acute attacks. Other things your doctor can do to find out if you have farmer's lung include: Pulmonary function test: This measures how much air you inhale and exhale. Bronchoscopy: Your doctor uses a device called a bronchoscope to look at your airways and lungs and collect a sample of fluid for testing. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep through this. Lung biopsy: If your doctor thinks you might have farmer's lung but can't be sure, he may want to take a sample of your lung tissue and send it to a lab for tests. You'll probably be given medicine to sleep through this as well. There's no cure for farmer's lung, but you can control it by staying away from the allergen that causes your symptoms. You might: Work outside as much as possible Avoid dusty work Wear a mask or other protective equipment Use fans, filters, or exhaust blowers wherever you can Steroid drugs like prednisone ( Deltasone, Orasone, Meticorten) can help with your symptoms because they can slow down your immune system and help with inflammation. Your doctor may only prescribe these if you have a chronic case, though. If steroids don't work, your doctor may want to prescribe and immune suppressant such as a drug called azathrioprine ( Azasan). In addition to recommending that you avoid your triggers, your doctor may also recommend bed rest or oxygen therapy, which involves getting extra oxygen through tubes in your nose or a mask, to help you feel better.", "question": "How does a pulmonary function test help diagnose farmer's lung?", "answer": ["Other things your doctor can do to find out if you have farmer's lung include: Pulmonary function test: This measures how much air you inhale and exhale."]}

But what does it mean if it's green? What about red, yellow, white, and black? Most of the time, minor changes in the color of your waste are due to diet. After all, we don't eat the same thing at every meal, every day. But sometimes a color change can signal a minor health issue. In rare cases, it means something serious is wrong in your digestive system. If the color you see before you flush worries you, call your doctor. Poop is normally brown. The color is the result of what you eat and how much bile is in your stool. Bile is a fluid your liver makes to digest fats. It starts out as a yellowish green color. But as the pigments that give bile its color travel through your digestive system, they go through chemical changes and turn brown. Most of the time, green or greenish poop is normal. Some of the things that can cause it: Green veggies, like spinach or kale Green food coloring, such as in drink mixes or ice pops Iron supplements If you have green diarrhea, the color of your food may not be to blame. It's likely that your meal moved through your gut too quickly, so the fat-digesting bile didn't have time to turn brown. This shade is also normal for many people. It's common for babies, especially those who breastfeed. But if you have yellow poop that looks greasy and smells very bad, it may have too much fat. That could be a sign your body isn't digesting food properly. For example, if you have celiac disease, your body can't handle a protein called gluten, which is in wheat, barley, and rye. If you have the condition and eat foods that have gluten, like many breads, pastas, and cookies, your intestines won't work as they should. There may be other causes of yellow poop that's greasy and smelly. If it happens to you often, tell your doctor. Medicines for diarrhea like bismuth subsalicylate ( Kaopectate, Pepto- Bismol) can sometimes cause pale or clay-colored poop. So can barium, a chalky liquid you drink before you get X-rays of the upper part of your digestive tract. A more serious cause is a lack of bile in your stool. ( Remember, bile gives poop its brown color.) Bile is made in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and released into your small intestine to help digest your food. If there's not enough of it to give your poop its typical brown color, it could be the sign of a problem along the way. Liver disease, such as hepatitis, can keep bile from getting into your body waste. So can a blockage in the tubes (called ducts) that carry bile. This can happen because of: Gallstones Tumor A condition you're born with called biliary atresia Babies' poop is black for the first few days after they're born. After that, it may be because you ate something very dark-colored or took a medicine or supplement that causes black poop. But this color can be a sign of a more serious problem: bleeding in the upper part of your digestive tract. Foods, medicines, and supplements that turn poop black include: Iron supplements Bismuth subsalicylate ( Kaopectate, Pepto- Bismol) Black licorice Blueberries Poop that looks like tar is often a sign of bleeding in the digestive tract. Some causes include: Ulcers Bleeding sores in your esophagus from acid reflux Noncancerous tumors Cancer If you don't think black poop came from what you ate, you need to talk to your doctor. If you see red or reddish poop in the toilet, don't be alarmed right away. First ask yourself if you've had red foods lately. Beets, Jell- O, tomato soup, and red drinks can change the color of your stool. If you don't think your diet is the cause, the red you see may be blood. And if it's bright red, the blood likely comes from the lower part of your digestive tract. Common causes include: Noncancerous tumors Cancer Inflammation in the colon, called colitis Growths called polyps in your colon Conditions caused by small sacs in the wall of the colon, called diverticular disease Hemorrhoids Call your doctor if you see red that's probably not from food you ate.", "question": "What does yellow poop mean?", "answer": ["This shade is also normal for many people.

It's more common in men than women, and more in whites than African- Americans. There's really nothing you can do to prevent leukemia. It's cancer of your blood cells caused by a rise in the number of white blood cells in your body. They crowd out the red blood cells and platelets your body needs to be healthy. All those extra white blood cells don't work right, and that causes problems. Blood has three types of cells: white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen, and platelets that help blood to clot. Every day, billions of new blood cells are made in the bone marrow -- most of them red cells. But when you have leukemia, your body makes more white cells than it needs. There are two main types of white blood cells in your body: lymphoid cells and myeloid cells. Leukemia can happen in either type. These leukemia cells can't fight infection the way normal white blood cells do. And because there are so many of them, they start to affect the way your major organs work. Eventually, there aren't enough red blood cells to supply oxygen, enough platelets to clot the blood, or enough normal white blood cells to fight infection. Along with infection, this can cause problems like anemia, bruising, and bleeding. Leukemia is grouped in two ways: How fast it develops and gets worse Which type of blood cell is involved (usually myeloid or lymphoid) These types are then put into one of two categories: acute or chronic. Acute leukemia happens when most of the abnormal blood cells stay immature and can't carry out normal functions. It can get bad very fast. Chronic leukemia happens when there are some immature cells, but others are normal and can function normally. That means it gets bad, but more slowly. No one knows exactly what causes leukemia. People who have it have certain abnormal chromosomes, but the chromosomes don't cause the leukemia. You can't really prevent leukemia, but it may be possible that certain things in your environment could trigger the development of it. For example, if you are a tobacco smoker, you are more prone to some types of leukemia than a nonsmoker. It's also associated with a high amount of radiation exposure and certain chemicals. Some kinds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy used to treat other cancers can actually cause leukemia. The chance that you'll develop leukemia depends on the types of chemotherapy drugs used. Family history is another risk factor for leukemia. For example, if an identical twin gets a certain type of leukemia, there is a 20% chance the other twin will have it within a year. The treatment you get depends on the type of leukemia you have, how far it has spread, and how healthy you are. But the main options are: Chemotherapy Radiation Biologic therapy Targeted therapy Stem cell transplant Surgery Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells in your blood and bone marrow. You can get the medicine: Through an injection into a vein or muscle As a pill Into the fluid around your spinal cord Radiation uses high-energy X-rays to kill leukemia cells or keep them from growing. You can get it in only one part of your body where there are a lot of cancer cells, or all over. Biologic therapy, also called immunotherapy, helps your immune system find and attack cancer cells. Drugs like interleukins and interferon can help boost your body's natural defenses against leukemia. Targeted therapy uses drugs to block specific genes or proteins that cancer cells need to grow. This treatment can stop the signals leukemia cells use to grow and divide, cut off their blood supply, or kill them directly. Stem cell transplant replaces the leukemia cells in your bone marrow with new ones that make blood. Your doctor can get the new stem cells from your own body or from a donor. First you'll have high doses of chemotherapy to destroy the cancer cells in your bone marrow. Then you'll get the new stem cells through an infusion into one of your veins. They will grow into new, healthy blood cells. Surgery. Your doctor can remove your spleen if it is filled with cancer cells and is pressing on nearby organs.

Every day, billions of new blood cells are made in the bone marrow -- most of them red cells. But when you have leukemia, your body makes more white cells than it needs. There are two main types of white blood cells in your body: lymphoid cells and myeloid cells. Leukemia can happen in either type. These leukemia cells can't fight infection the way normal white blood cells do. And because there are so many of them, they start to affect the way your major organs work. Eventually, there aren't enough red blood cells to supply oxygen, enough platelets to clot the blood, or enough normal white blood cells to fight infection. Along with infection, this can cause problems like anemia, bruising, and bleeding. Leukemia is grouped in two ways: How fast it develops and gets worse Which type of blood cell is involved (usually myeloid or lymphoid) These types are then put into one of two categories: acute or chronic. Acute leukemia happens when most of the abnormal blood cells stay immature and can't carry out normal functions. It can get bad very fast. Chronic leukemia happens when there are some immature cells, but others are normal and can function normally. That means it gets bad, but more slowly. No one knows exactly what causes leukemia. People who have it have certain abnormal chromosomes, but the chromosomes don't cause the leukemia. You can't really prevent leukemia, but it may be possible that certain things in your environment could trigger the development of it. For example, if you are a tobacco smoker, you are more prone to some types of leukemia than a nonsmoker. It's also associated with a high amount of radiation exposure and certain chemicals. Some kinds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy used to treat other cancers can actually cause leukemia. The chance that you'll develop leukemia depends on the types of chemotherapy drugs used. Family history is another risk factor for leukemia. For example, if an identical twin gets a certain type of leukemia, there is a 20% chance the other twin will have it within a year. The treatment you get depends on the type of leukemia you have, how far it has spread, and how healthy you are. But the main options are: Chemotherapy Radiation Biologic therapy Targeted therapy Stem cell transplant Surgery Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells in your blood and bone marrow. You can get the medicine: Through an injection into a vein or muscle As a pill Into the fluid around your spinal cord Radiation uses high-energy X-rays to kill leukemia cells or keep them from growing. You can get it in only one part of your body where there are a lot of cancer cells, or all over. Biologic therapy, also called immunotherapy, helps your immune system find and attack cancer cells. Drugs like interleukins and interferon can help boost your body's natural defenses against leukemia. Targeted therapy uses drugs to block specific genes or proteins that cancer cells need to grow. This treatment can stop the signals leukemia cells use to grow and divide, cut off their blood supply, or kill them directly. Stem cell transplant replaces the leukemia cells in your bone marrow with new ones that make blood. Your doctor can get the new stem cells from your own body or from a donor. First you'll have high doses of chemotherapy to destroy the cancer cells in your bone marrow. Then you'll get the new stem cells through an infusion into one of your veins.

Generally, the earlier you and your doctor catch it, the simpler it is to handle. The treatment you get will depend on a few things: How deep the melanoma is in your skin Whether it has spread to other parts of your body Your general health Often, the first step is to remove the tumor from your skin, usually with surgery. Your doctor or surgeon will numb your skin and cut out the melanoma, plus some extra skin around it. You'll have stitches for 1-2 weeks. If it isn't deep, a doctor who treats skin, called a dermatologist, can do the operation during a regular surgery visit, and you can go home right after. This might be all you need, especially if the cancer is only in the top layer of your skin. If the tumor has grown deep into your skin or spread to other parts of your body, treatment is more complex. You might need surgery to remove lymph nodes near the melanoma to see if the cancer has spread there. For example, if the problem is on your arm, the surgeon might take out the lymph nodes under your armpit. Other options are: Immunotherapy. This approach uses drugs that help your immune system find and attack cancer cells. You might get them in a shot or go to a treatment center or hospital to get them through an IV every 2-4 weeks. If the melanoma is on your face, your doctor might prescribe a cream that revs up the immune cells only around the tumor, instead of in your whole body like the other drugs. Sometimes, immunotherapy drugs can make your body attack your healthy organs. If that happens, you'll need to stop taking them and get other treatment to stop the attack. Chemotherapy. These drugs travel through your body and attack cancer cells. Some chemotherapy drugs are pills, and others you get through an IV. Targeted therapy. Cancer happens when cells grow and divide too fast or don't die when they should. This can happen because of bad genes inside the cells. In targeted therapy, drugs go after changes in melanoma cells that make them grow out of control. This treatment tends to stop working well after a while. If that happens, you and your doctor will need to try another approach. Radiation. A specialist will zap the area with high-energy rays, which kill cancer cells. It's like getting an X-ray, but the dose is stronger. Clinical trials. Scientists are working on finding new treatments for melanoma. But they have to test them and compare how they work to current therapies before they become available for everyone. They do this in research studies called clinical trials. Your doctor might know if you can sign up for one. If you're accepted, you could get either a regular treatment that's already available or the one that scientists are testing. Your doctor might recommend more than one treatment at a time, like chemotherapy plus radiation. It depends on whether the cancer has spread and how far it has gone. Melanoma treatments might cause other kinds of health problems, including: Pain Scars Swelling in your arms or legs, called lymphedema. It happens when your body holds on to fluid because your lymph system is blocked or damaged. Infection Feeling tired Feeling sick to your stomach Constipation or diarrhea Anxiety or depression The side effects you have depend on the stage of your disease, how much treatment you get and how long it takes, and your general health. Some of them can last for a while after you finish treatment. Be sure to tell your doctor if you have any side effects, even if you think they're no big deal. There are almost always ways to control them so you'll feel better. Melanoma can come back after treatment. It can show up where it was before, or it can start on other places on your skin or in an organ inside your body like your liver. Your doctor will want to watch you closely for signs that the disease has returned, so it's important to keep your appointments for checkups.

Generally, the earlier you and your doctor catch it, the simpler it is to handle. The treatment you get will depend on a few things: How deep the melanoma is in your skin Whether it has spread to other parts of your body Your general health Often, the first step is to remove the tumor from your skin, usually with surgery. Your doctor or surgeon will numb your skin and cut out the melanoma, plus some extra skin around it. You'll have stitches for 1-2 weeks. If it isn't deep, a doctor who treats skin, called a dermatologist, can do the operation during a regular surgery visit, and you can go home right after. This might be all you need, especially if the cancer is only in the top layer of your skin. If the tumor has grown deep into your skin or spread to other parts of your body, treatment is more complex. You might need surgery to remove lymph nodes near the melanoma to see if the cancer has spread there. For example, if the problem is on your arm, the surgeon might take out the lymph nodes under your armpit. Other options are: Immunotherapy. This approach uses drugs that help your immune system find and attack cancer cells. You might get them in a shot or go to a treatment center or hospital to get them through an IV every 2-4 weeks. If the melanoma is on your face, your doctor might prescribe a cream that revs up the immune cells only around the tumor, instead of in your whole body like the other drugs. Sometimes, immunotherapy drugs can make your body attack your healthy organs. If that happens, you'll need to stop taking them and get other treatment to stop the attack. Chemotherapy. These drugs travel through your body and attack cancer cells. Some chemotherapy drugs are pills, and others you get through an IV. Targeted therapy. Cancer happens when cells grow and divide too fast or don't die when they should. This can happen because of bad genes inside the cells. In targeted therapy, drugs go after changes in melanoma cells that make them grow out of control. This treatment tends to stop working well after a while. If that happens, you and your doctor will need to try another approach. Radiation. A specialist will zap the area with high-energy rays, which kill cancer cells. It's like getting an X-ray, but the dose is stronger. Clinical trials. Scientists are working on finding new treatments for melanoma. But they have to test them and compare how they work to current therapies before they become available for everyone. They do this in research studies called clinical trials.

What about your heart? Research shows that some of them may help lower cholesterol, improve blood pressure, and other things that put you at risk for heart disease. It's unclear, though, if they help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other problems. Here are six nutrients that can be a good addition to your heart-healthy lifestyle. Fiber. Found naturally in fruits, grains, vegetables, and legumes, fiber cuts down the amount of cholesterol your body soaks up from food. Try to get at least 25 to 30 grams of it every day. Men less than age 51 should aim for 38 grams a day. It's best to get your daily dose from your diet, but supplements are another option. There's good evidence that blond psyllium husk -- common in fiber supplements -- can lower âbadâ LDL cholesterol. It can also raise the âgoodâ kind, HDL. Other fiber supplements include methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil.. If you take a fiber supplement, increase the amount you take slowly. This can help prevent gas and cramping. It's also important to drink enough liquids when you increase your fiber intake. Sterols and stanols. Find these in foods like nuts and grains, or you can buy them as supplements. They reduce the amount of cholesterol that your body absorbs from food. They're also added to many foods, such as some margarines, orange juice, and yogurts. Experts recommend 2 grams a day to help lower LDL cholesterol for people who have high cholesterol. Coenzyme Q10 ( Co Q10 ). Your body naturally makes small amounts of this enzyme, also known as ubiquinone and ubiquinol. As a supplement, Co Q10 may help lower blood pressure, either on its own or along with medications. Other studies have found that adding it to heart failure drugs may help people feel better day to day. Co Q10 pills are also popular as a treatment for the side effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins. Why? These meds can sometimes lower the amount of Co Q10 the body makes on its own. Some doctors suggest adding a Co Q10 supplement to make up for the loss, hoping it will relieve problems like muscle pain and weakness. But study results have been mixed. Fish oil . Full of omega-3 fatty acids, it can slash levels of triglycerides -- an unhealthy fat in your blood -- by up to 30%. It may also improve blood pressure. But it's not clear if non-prescription fish oil supplements lower your risk of heart attack and stroke. Your best bet may be to eat fish with omega-3 fatty acids. The American Heart Association recommends that all adults eat at least two 3.5-ounce servings of fish a week. Garlic. Not only does it make just about anything taste delicious, it could also slightly lower blood pressure. It may slow the buildup of plaque in your arteries, lowering your risk of blood clots. Research shows that both garlic in food and in supplements may help. Green tea . Research shows that both the extract and the drink may lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and raise HDL levels. Don't take a supplement just because it's labeled \"heart healthy.\" Not all of them are guaranteed to help you, and it can be dangerous to get too much of some of them. Pay attention to what the supplement does, and make sure you really need it. Ask your doctor which product is most likely to help. If you have a heart condition or for a high risk for a heart attack, you must follow your doctor's advice. It's way too risky to try to treat a serious health condition on your own with over-the-counter supplements.", "question": "Are sterols and stanols good for heart health?", "answer": ["Find these in foods like nuts and grains, or you can buy them as supplements.

They're about the size of a pea. They produce fluid that keeps the vagina moist. The fluid travels to the vagina through ducts (tubes). If they become blocked, fluid can back up into them. This forms a swelling -- a cyst. Doctors call these Bartholin's gland cysts. Most of the time, they don't hurt. They're almost always benign, or non-cancerous. Doctors aren't sure why the glands sometimes become blocked. In rare cases, it may be due to a sexually transmitted infection ( STI) like gonorrhea or chlamydia. About two out of 10 women can expect to get a Bartholin's gland cyst at some point. It typically happens in your 20s. They're less likely to develop as you age. You may not have any, unless the cyst is large or becomes infected. If infection sets in (doctors call this an âabscessâ), you'll likely have extreme pain at the site of the cyst. Sex -- and even walking -- may hurt. If the cyst is large, it can make one side of your labia majora (the large folds of skin on the outside of your vagina) hang lower than the other. You might also have fever and an unusual vaginal discharge. Only your doctor can tell you for sure. He'll do a physical exam. He'll also likely take a sample of your vaginal discharge and look at it under a microscope. This will reveal whether you have an STI. If you have an abscess, he'll take a culture of it and send it to a lab. If you're over 40, he may do a biopsy (sample of tissue from the cyst) to rule out vulvar cancer. That's a disease that affects the lips that surround your vagina. If your exam shows that you have an STI, or if your cyst is infected, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic. He may also prescribe topical medications. If you're under 40 and your cyst isn't causing problems, you probably won't need treatment. A simple sitz bath may help the cyst go away on its own. Simply fill a tub with 3 to 4 inches of water (enough to cover your vulva), and gently sit. Do this several times a day for three or four days. The cyst may burst and drain on its own. If the Bartholin's cyst is causing problems -- or if it's turned into an abscess -- you'll need to see your doctor. He'll treat it in one of three ways: Surgical drainage. Your doctor will make a small cut in the cyst. He'll then place a small rubber tube (catheter) into the opening to allow it to drain. It can stay in place for up to 6 weeks. You'll feel better right away after the fluid has been drained. But you may need to take oral pain medication for several days afterwards. Keep in mind that a Bartholin's cyst or abscess may come back and need treatment again. Side effects include pain or discomfort -- especially during sex. You might also have swelling of the labia (lips around the vagina), infection, bleeding, or scarring. Marsupialization. If cysts bother you or come back, this procedure may help. Your doctor cuts the cyst to open it. He then stitches the skin around the cyst to form a small pouch. This allows the fluid to drain out. He packs the area with special gauze to soak up the fluid and any blood. The whole process takes less than half an hour, and you can go home the same day. Your doctor may prescribe painkillers afterward. There's also a risk of infection, bleeding, and the abscess coming back. Removal of the gland. Your doctor might recommend this option if others haven't worked or you keep getting Bartholin's cysts and abscesses.

That's a disease that affects the lips that surround your vagina. If your exam shows that you have an STI, or if your cyst is infected, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic. He may also prescribe topical medications. If you're under 40 and your cyst isn't causing problems, you probably won't need treatment. A simple sitz bath may help the cyst go away on its own. Simply fill a tub with 3 to 4 inches of water (enough to cover your vulva), and gently sit. Do this several times a day for three or four days. The cyst may burst and drain on its own. If the Bartholin's cyst is causing problems -- or if it's turned into an abscess -- you'll need to see your doctor. He'll treat it in one of three ways: Surgical drainage. Your doctor will make a small cut in the cyst. He'll then place a small rubber tube (catheter) into the opening to allow it to drain. It can stay in place for up to 6 weeks. You'll feel better right away after the fluid has been drained. But you may need to take oral pain medication for several days afterwards. Keep in mind that a Bartholin's cyst or abscess may come back and need treatment again. Side effects include pain or discomfort -- especially during sex. You might also have swelling of the labia (lips around the vagina), infection, bleeding, or scarring. Marsupialization. If cysts bother you or come back, this procedure may help. Your doctor cuts the cyst to open it. He then stitches the skin around the cyst to form a small pouch. This allows the fluid to drain out. He packs the area with special gauze to soak up the fluid and any blood. The whole process takes less than half an hour, and you can go home the same day. Your doctor may prescribe painkillers afterward. There's also a risk of infection, bleeding, and the abscess coming back. Removal of the gland. Your doctor might recommend this option if others haven't worked or you keep getting Bartholin's cysts and abscesses.

They're about the size of a pea. They produce fluid that keeps the vagina moist. The fluid travels to the vagina through ducts (tubes). If they become blocked, fluid can back up into them. This forms a swelling -- a cyst. Doctors call these Bartholin's gland cysts. Most of the time, they don't hurt. They're almost always benign, or non-cancerous. Doctors aren't sure why the glands sometimes become blocked. In rare cases, it may be due to a sexually transmitted infection ( STI) like gonorrhea or chlamydia. About two out of 10 women can expect to get a Bartholin's gland cyst at some point. It typically happens in your 20s. They're less likely to develop as you age. You may not have any, unless the cyst is large or becomes infected. If infection sets in (doctors call this an âabscessâ), you'll likely have extreme pain at the site of the cyst. Sex -- and even walking -- may hurt. If the cyst is large, it can make one side of your labia majora (the large folds of skin on the outside of your vagina) hang lower than the other. You might also have fever and an unusual vaginal discharge. Only your doctor can tell you for sure. He'll do a physical exam.

Then: Put a plastic comb flat against the scale and gently rub it in a circle. As the scale loosens, try to comb it out of your hair. Wash your hair to remove any leftover scales.

There are several different types, causes, and treatments. With this type, urine leaks due to weakened pelvic floor muscles and tissues. It can happen when pressure on your bladder increases -- such as when you exercise, laugh, sneeze, or cough. Pregnancy and childbirth can stretch and weaken a woman's pelvic floor muscles. Other things that can lead to stress incontinence are being overweight or obese, taking certain medications or, in men, having prostate surgery. This is also called overactive bladder ( OAB). With this type, you have an urgent need to go to the bathroom and may not get there in time. Causes of overactive bladder include: Damage to the bladder's nerves Damage to other parts of the nervous system Damage to muscles Aging Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and stroke can affect nerves, leading to urge incontinence. Bladder problems, such as infections and bladder stones, and certain medications can also cause it. If you can't empty your bladder, you may have overflow incontinence. This means you may dribble urine. Causes include: Weak bladder muscles Nerve damage Conditions that block the flow of urine, such as tumors or an enlarged prostate Constipation Certain medications You need to get the condition treated. If your bladder can't empty, that can lead to infections and other problems. Mental or physical problems such as dementia or arthritis prevent you from getting to the bathroom in time. This means you have any two types of the condition. Many women have both stress and urge incontinence. Lifestyle changes and treatments can help with symptoms. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan that's right for you. For stress incontinence, treatments include: Pads and Vaginal Inserts. Pelvic floor exercises. If you've had a baby, chances are you've been told to do Kegel exercises. These help to strengthen the pelvic floor after childbirth. They also help prevent stress incontinence. Best of all, you can do Kegels anytime, anywhere. Here's how: Squeeze the muscles that you use stop the flow of urine. Hold the squeeze for 10 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds. Do 3 or 4 sets daily. Note: You can learn how to do Kegels by stopping your urine, but don't do this routinely. Stopping the flow of urine can lead to an infection. Biofeedback . A probe is inserted to monitor when your bladder muscles squeeze. When you're able to recognize it as it's happening, you can start to gain control of it. It's often used in combination with Kegel exercises. Pessary. For women, doctors may prescribe a device called a pessary that is inserted into the vagina. It repositions the urethra to help reduce leakage. Injections and surgery. Shots to bulk up your urethral area may help. In more extreme cases, you may need surgery. One procedure pulls the bladder (urethra) back up to a more normal position, relieving the pressure and leakage. Another surgery involves securing the bladder (urethra) with a \"sling,\" a piece of material that holds up the bladder to prevent leakage. For urge incontinence, treatment options include: Timed voiding and bladder training. First, you complete a chart of the times you pee and the times you leak. You observe patterns and then plan to empty your bladder before an accident would happen. You can also \"retrain\" your bladder, gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits. Kegel exercises are also helpful. Medications, electrical stimulation, or surgery. Doctors sometimes prescribe medicines (or inject Botox in the bladder) that block the contractions of an overactive bladder. Electrical stimulation of the bladder nerves helps in some cases. Surgery is reserved for severe cases. It aims to increase the amount of urine your bladder can store. For overflow incontinence, treatments include: Pads. Medication or surgery. Meds called alpha-blockers often can help if the problem is caused by an enlarged prostate. If there's a blockage, you may need surgery. Catheter. Some people use a catheter to make sure their bladder is emptied. It's a thin plastic tube that you insert in your urethra. A doctor or nurse can teach you how to insert it for yourself. It's important to identify any underlying disease or blockage causing overflow incontinence and treat that. You might feel embarrassed to talk about your urinary incontinence, but it's worth it. Your doctor can help you figure out what's causing your problem. That's the first step to getting help. Be straightforward. Just tell your doctor you're having problems. Keep it simple: \" I'm having bladder problems.\" Your doctor should ask questions, like how long the leakage has been happening, how bad it is, and how much it upsets your life.

You will be asked to wear a hospital gown during the MRI scan. As the MRI scan begins, you will hear the equipment making a muffled thumping sound, which will last for several minutes. Other than the sound, you should notice no unusual sensations during the scanning. Certain MRI exams require an injection of a dye (contrast material). This helps identify certain anatomic structures on the scan images. Before the exam, feel free to ask questions and tell the technician or doctor if you have any concerns. People who get anxious when in tight spaces (claustrophobic) may benefit from talking to their doctor before the procedure. Some options include taking a prescription medication before the procedure to relieve anxiety or having the exam done in one of the newer and less confining MRI units, called an open MRI, when available.

Day of Your Hip Replacement Surgery You'll check in several hours before your scheduled surgery. Expect to stay for 3 to 4 days. The procedure will probably last about 2 to 3 hours. Recovery from anesthesia will probably take about 2 hours. Once you're fully awake, you'll go to your hospital room. You will likely stick to a liquid diet for the rest of the day. You will need medication to help with pain and to prevent infection and blood clots. 1 to 2 Days After Hip Replacement Surgery You'll get out of bed -- with assistance -- and start moving around using a walker or crutches. You will see physical and occupational therapists. They will help you learn how to move safely with minimal pain. You probably won't be able to do certain movements for a few weeks. The day after surgery, you can usually begin eating a normal diet. You'll see many different people from the hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, and case workers. You'll likely shift from intravenous ( IV) to oral pain medications. 3 Days After Hip Replacement Surgery Walking will likely be easier. You may be able to walk to the bathroom without help. You will be discharged from the hospital if you are doing well. Some people stay longer if they have complications. Depending on your situation, you may go straight home or to a rehab facility, where you'll recover. 4+ Days After Hip Replacement Surgery Follow your doctor's instructions for taking care of your incision. Keep the area dry and stick to sponge baths to prevent infection. Do not let your incision get wet, like in a tub. Report any signs of infection -- such as increased redness, drainage from the incision, or fever -- to your doctor right away. Keep doing the suggested physical therapy exercises. You may get home visits from nurses and the physical therapist. You should need less pain medication. Move about as much as possible. This will help maintain good blood flow in your legs and help prevent blood clots. 10 to 14 Days After Hip Replacement Surgery The staples from your incision will be removed. At this point, you can start taking baths or showers. 3 to 6 Weeks After Hip Replacement Surgery You may be able to do most light activities. You'll likely be able to walk without a walker or crutches. You may be able to drive again 10 to 12 Weeks After Hip Replacement Surgery You may be able to return to all of your normal activities.", "question": "What should I expect on the 3rd day after my hip replacement surgery?", "answer": ["3 Days After Hip Replacement Surgery Walking will likely be easier.

{"id": "027a239056f2a7e21174dba58347dfbd", "url": "https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/qa/what-are-situational-phobias", "subject": "", "topic": "", "context": "The term \"phobia\" refers to a group of anxiety symptoms brought on by certain objects or situations. A specific phobia, formerly called a simple phobia, is a lasting and unreasonable fear caused by the presence or thought of a specific object or situation that usually poses little or no actual danger. Exposure to the object or situation brings about an immediate reaction, causing the person to endure intense anxiety (nervousness) or to avoid the object or situation entirely. The distress associated with the phobia and/or the need to avoid the object or situation can significantly interfere with the person's ability to function. Adults with a specific phobia recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable, yet are unable to overcome it. There are different types of specific phobias, based on the object or situation feared, including: Animal phobias: Examples include the fear of dogs, snakes, insects, or mice. Animal phobias are the most common specific phobias. Situational phobias: These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator. Natural environment phobias: Examples include the fear of storms, heights, or water. Blood-injection-injury phobias: These involve a fear of being injured, of seeing blood or of invasive medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections Other phobias: These include a fear of falling down, a fear of loud sounds, and a fear of costumed characters, such as clowns. A person can have more than one specific phobia. Symptoms of specific phobias may include: Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart, nausea or diarrhea, sweating, trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking Anticipatory anxiety, which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia; for example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because he or she may see a dog along the way. Children with a specific phobia may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that about 5%-12% of Americans have phobias. Specific phobias affect an estimated 6.3 million adult Americans. Phobias usually first appear in adolescence and adulthood, but can occur in people of all ages. They are slightly more common in women than in men. Specific phobias in children are common and usually disappear over time. Specific phobias in adults generally start suddenly and are more lasting than childhood phobias. Only about 20% of specific phobias in adults go away on their own (without treatment). The exact cause of specific phobias is not known, but most appear to be associated with a traumatic experience or a learned reaction. For example, a person who has a frightening or threatening experience with an animal, such as an attack or being bitten, can develop a specific phobia. Witnessing a traumatic event in which others experience harm or extreme fear can also cause a specific phobia, as can receiving information or repeated warnings about potentially dangerous situations or animals. Fear can be learned from others, as well. A child whose parents react with fear and anxiety to certain objects or situations is likely to also respond to those objects with fear. If symptoms of a specific phobia are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a medical and psychiatric history and may perform a brief physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose specific phobias, the doctor may use various tests to make sure that a physical illness isn't the cause of the symptoms. If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use clinical interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a specific phobia. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis of specific phobias on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. A specific phobia is diagnosed if the person's fear and anxiety are particularly distressing or if they interfere with his or her daily routine, including school, work, social activities, and relationships. Treatment for specific phobias may include one or a combination of: Cognitive behavioral therapy : Psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for specific phobias. Treatment usually involves a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called systematic desensitization or exposure and response prevention ( ERP) therapy, in which patients are gradually exposed to what frightens them until their fear begins to fade. Medication : For situational phobias that produce intense, temporary anxiety (for example, a fear of flying), short-acting sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) such as Ativan, or Xanax may be prescribed on an occasional, as-needed basis to help reduce anticipatory anxiety. Unless a phobia is accompanied by other conditions such as depression or panic disorder, long-term or daily medicines are generally not used. Occasionally, serotonergic antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac or Lexapromay have potential value for some patients. More recently, common blood pressure drugs called beta-blockers have been used to treat anxiety related to specific phobias. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, may also help reduce anxiety symptoms. For most people, specific phobias can be successfully treated with therapy, medication, or a combination of both. Although many specific phobias cannot be prevented, early intervention and treatment following a traumatic experience, such as an animal attack, may prevent the person from developing a severe anxiety disorder.", "question": "What are situational phobias?", "answer": ["Situational phobias: These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator."]}

Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose specific phobias, the doctor may use various tests to make sure that a physical illness isn't the cause of the symptoms. If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use clinical interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a specific phobia. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis of specific phobias on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. A specific phobia is diagnosed if the person's fear and anxiety are particularly distressing or if they interfere with his or her daily routine, including school, work, social activities, and relationships. Treatment for specific phobias may include one or a combination of: Cognitive behavioral therapy : Psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for specific phobias. Treatment usually involves a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called systematic desensitization or exposure and response prevention ( ERP) therapy, in which patients are gradually exposed to what frightens them until their fear begins to fade. Medication : For situational phobias that produce intense, temporary anxiety (for example, a fear of flying), short-acting sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) such as Ativan, or Xanax may be prescribed on an occasional, as-needed basis to help reduce anticipatory anxiety. Unless a phobia is accompanied by other conditions such as depression or panic disorder, long-term or daily medicines are generally not used. Occasionally, serotonergic antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac or Lexapromay have potential value for some patients. More recently, common blood pressure drugs called beta-blockers have been used to treat anxiety related to specific phobias. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, may also help reduce anxiety symptoms. For most people, specific phobias can be successfully treated with therapy, medication, or a combination of both. Although many specific phobias cannot be prevented, early intervention and treatment following a traumatic experience, such as an animal attack, may prevent the person from developing a severe anxiety disorder.", "question": "What are blood injection/injury phobias?", "answer": ["Blood-injection-injury phobias: These involve a fear of being injured, of seeing blood or of invasive medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections Other phobias: These include a fear of falling down, a fear of loud sounds, and a fear of costumed characters, such as clowns."]}

A specific phobia, formerly called a simple phobia, is a lasting and unreasonable fear caused by the presence or thought of a specific object or situation that usually poses little or no actual danger. Exposure to the object or situation brings about an immediate reaction, causing the person to endure intense anxiety (nervousness) or to avoid the object or situation entirely. The distress associated with the phobia and/or the need to avoid the object or situation can significantly interfere with the person's ability to function. Adults with a specific phobia recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable, yet are unable to overcome it. There are different types of specific phobias, based on the object or situation feared, including: Animal phobias: Examples include the fear of dogs, snakes, insects, or mice. Animal phobias are the most common specific phobias. Situational phobias: These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator. Natural environment phobias: Examples include the fear of storms, heights, or water. Blood-injection-injury phobias: These involve a fear of being injured, of seeing blood or of invasive medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections Other phobias: These include a fear of falling down, a fear of loud sounds, and a fear of costumed characters, such as clowns. A person can have more than one specific phobia. Symptoms of specific phobias may include: Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart, nausea or diarrhea, sweating, trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking Anticipatory anxiety, which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia; for example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because he or she may see a dog along the way. Children with a specific phobia may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that about 5%-12% of Americans have phobias. Specific phobias affect an estimated 6.3 million adult Americans. Phobias usually first appear in adolescence and adulthood, but can occur in people of all ages. They are slightly more common in women than in men. Specific phobias in children are common and usually disappear over time. Specific phobias in adults generally start suddenly and are more lasting than childhood phobias. Only about 20% of specific phobias in adults go away on their own (without treatment). The exact cause of specific phobias is not known, but most appear to be associated with a traumatic experience or a learned reaction. For example, a person who has a frightening or threatening experience with an animal, such as an attack or being bitten, can develop a specific phobia. Witnessing a traumatic event in which others experience harm or extreme fear can also cause a specific phobia, as can receiving information or repeated warnings about potentially dangerous situations or animals.

While genes and life stress may contribute to it, experts believe that symptoms may arise from a problem with nerve circuits and areas in the brain that control emotion, thinking, and behavior. The best treatment for bipolar disorder is often a combination of medication and counseling. Other treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) are often successful for people with very severe symptoms who don't respond to traditional therapy or who can't take the medications. Doctors sometimes treat the mania symptoms of bipolar disorder with one set of drugs and the depression symptoms with another, although some mood-stabilizing drugs are effective at treating both kinds of symptoms. Certain drugs are also used for \"maintenance\" to maintain a steady mood. Antidepressants are usually not used alone because they sometimes cause manic attacks in depressed patients, and they may be less effective for treating bipolar than unipolar depression. Many people respond well to medications for bipolar disorder. For many others, the symptoms do not completely disappear despite therapy. The mood symptoms may become less intense and more manageable, however. Remember, getting your diagnosis should come as a relief. Now you know what the problem has been and you're on the road to getting the right treatment. If you are suffering from bipolar mania, your doctor at first may treat you with an anti-manic mood stabilizer and sometimes also an antipsychotic drug and/or a benzodiazepine to quickly control hyperactivity, sleeplessness, hostility, and irritability. Mood stabilizers treat manias or depressions without causing symptoms to swing the other way. Some also may help to reduce the risk of suicide. They are usually taken for a long time, commonly for many years. Examples include lithium and certain anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine ( Tegretol), lamotrigine ( Lamictal) or valproate ( Depakote). Atypical antipsychotics used to treat mania include aripiprazole ( Abilify), asenapine ( Saphris), cariprazine ( Vryalar), olanzapine ( Zyprexa), quetiapine ( Seroquel), risperidone ( Risperdal), and ziprasidone ( Geodon) . Treating bipolar mania often requires hospitalization because there is high risk for unpredictable, reckless behavior and noncompliance with treatment. For people with extreme mania, pregnant women with mania, or those people whose mania can't be controlled with mood stabilizers, doctors sometimes also recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). If mania occurs while you are on maintenance therapy, your doctor may simply change your medication dose. Or you may start taking an antipsychotic drug or a second mood stabilizer to lessen symptoms. Also antidepressants should usually be discontinued while someone is manic, because they can worsen the symptoms of mania. Non-drug treatments, such as psychotherapy and establishing a well-ordered routine, may help patients in their maintenance phase. This is often suggested along with medication, but non-drug treatments are usually not effective alone. Treating bipolar depression is controversial and challenging. Studies have shown that antidepressants may be less effective in treating bipolar depression than they are in treating unipolar depression (that is, major depressive episodes in someone who has never had a previous manic or hypomanic episode). Also using antidepressants alone may trigger a manic or hypomanic episode in some people with bipolar disorder. Antidepressants alone also may lead to or prolong rapid cycling. In rapid cycling, a person may recover more quickly from depression but then experience mania followed by another episode of depression. And antidepressants can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts in children and adolescents with any form of depression. Three drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of bipolar depression: quetiapine ( Seroquel) by itself, olanzapine ( Zyprexa) when used with fluoxetine ( Prozac) (which also comes as a combination pill called Symbyax), and lurasidone ( Latuda) used alone or with lithium or valproate ( Depakote). The atypical antipsychotic drug caripirazine ( Vraylar) has also shown promise in initial studies to treat bipolar depression. There are also a number of treatments that have begun to show promise in research studies for treating bipolar depression, including the Parkinson's disease drug pramipexole dihydrochloride ( Mirapex), the wakefulness drugs modafinil ( Provigil) and armodinifinil ( Nuvigil), the nutritional supplement n-acetylcysteine, and the intravenous anesthetic drug ketamine. In April 2002, the American Psychiatric Association suggested using lithium or the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine ( Lamictal) as an initial treatment for people in the acute depressive phase of bipolar disorder who were not already taking a mood-stabilizing drug. Since then, research has shown that Lamictal seems to be more effective at preventing future depression rather than treating current depression in bipolar disorder. Recent studies have shown that Lamictal added to lithium may be a potent treatment for acute bipolar depression. For depressed bipolar patients who don't respond to mood stabilizers alone, or to FDA-approved medications for bipolar depression, doctors sometimes prescribe a mood stabilizer plus a traditional antidepressant -- often either buproprion ( Wellbutrin) or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) such as fluoxetine ( Prozac) or sertraline ( Zoloft), although the effectiveness of antidepressants has not been proven for bipolar depression. If all else fails, or if symptoms are especially severe, doctors may recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). It helps nearly 75% of the patients who are given this treatment. Two treatments called vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r TMS) are also being studied as a treatment for bipolar depression. In addition, psychotherapy may be beneficial when added to drug treatment. Once depression has resolved, mood stabilizers are the best-proven treatments to prevent either future depression or manias. If psychotic symptoms occur during an acute depressive episode, the doctor may recommend antipsychotic medicine.

Other treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) are often successful for people with very severe symptoms who don't respond to traditional therapy or who can't take the medications. Doctors sometimes treat the mania symptoms of bipolar disorder with one set of drugs and the depression symptoms with another, although some mood-stabilizing drugs are effective at treating both kinds of symptoms. Certain drugs are also used for \"maintenance\" to maintain a steady mood. Antidepressants are usually not used alone because they sometimes cause manic attacks in depressed patients, and they may be less effective for treating bipolar than unipolar depression. Many people respond well to medications for bipolar disorder. For many others, the symptoms do not completely disappear despite therapy. The mood symptoms may become less intense and more manageable, however. Remember, getting your diagnosis should come as a relief. Now you know what the problem has been and you're on the road to getting the right treatment. If you are suffering from bipolar mania, your doctor at first may treat you with an anti-manic mood stabilizer and sometimes also an antipsychotic drug and/or a benzodiazepine to quickly control hyperactivity, sleeplessness, hostility, and irritability. Mood stabilizers treat manias or depressions without causing symptoms to swing the other way. Some also may help to reduce the risk of suicide. They are usually taken for a long time, commonly for many years. Examples include lithium and certain anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine ( Tegretol), lamotrigine ( Lamictal) or valproate ( Depakote). Atypical antipsychotics used to treat mania include aripiprazole ( Abilify), asenapine ( Saphris), cariprazine ( Vryalar), olanzapine ( Zyprexa), quetiapine ( Seroquel), risperidone ( Risperdal), and ziprasidone ( Geodon) . Treating bipolar mania often requires hospitalization because there is high risk for unpredictable, reckless behavior and noncompliance with treatment. For people with extreme mania, pregnant women with mania, or those people whose mania can't be controlled with mood stabilizers, doctors sometimes also recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). If mania occurs while you are on maintenance therapy, your doctor may simply change your medication dose. Or you may start taking an antipsychotic drug or a second mood stabilizer to lessen symptoms. Also antidepressants should usually be discontinued while someone is manic, because they can worsen the symptoms of mania. Non-drug treatments, such as psychotherapy and establishing a well-ordered routine, may help patients in their maintenance phase. This is often suggested along with medication, but non-drug treatments are usually not effective alone. Treating bipolar depression is controversial and challenging. Studies have shown that antidepressants may be less effective in treating bipolar depression than they are in treating unipolar depression (that is, major depressive episodes in someone who has never had a previous manic or hypomanic episode). Also using antidepressants alone may trigger a manic or hypomanic episode in some people with bipolar disorder. Antidepressants alone also may lead to or prolong rapid cycling. In rapid cycling, a person may recover more quickly from depression but then experience mania followed by another episode of depression. And antidepressants can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts in children and adolescents with any form of depression. Three drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of bipolar depression: quetiapine ( Seroquel) by itself, olanzapine ( Zyprexa) when used with fluoxetine ( Prozac) (which also comes as a combination pill called Symbyax), and lurasidone ( Latuda) used alone or with lithium or valproate ( Depakote). The atypical antipsychotic drug caripirazine ( Vraylar) has also shown promise in initial studies to treat bipolar depression. There are also a number of treatments that have begun to show promise in research studies for treating bipolar depression, including the Parkinson's disease drug pramipexole dihydrochloride ( Mirapex), the wakefulness drugs modafinil ( Provigil) and armodinifinil ( Nuvigil), the nutritional supplement n-acetylcysteine, and the intravenous anesthetic drug ketamine. In April 2002, the American Psychiatric Association suggested using lithium or the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine ( Lamictal) as an initial treatment for people in the acute depressive phase of bipolar disorder who were not already taking a mood-stabilizing drug. Since then, research has shown that Lamictal seems to be more effective at preventing future depression rather than treating current depression in bipolar disorder. Recent studies have shown that Lamictal added to lithium may be a potent treatment for acute bipolar depression. For depressed bipolar patients who don't respond to mood stabilizers alone, or to FDA-approved medications for bipolar depression, doctors sometimes prescribe a mood stabilizer plus a traditional antidepressant -- often either buproprion ( Wellbutrin) or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) such as fluoxetine ( Prozac) or sertraline ( Zoloft), although the effectiveness of antidepressants has not been proven for bipolar depression. If all else fails, or if symptoms are especially severe, doctors may recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). It helps nearly 75% of the patients who are given this treatment. Two treatments called vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r TMS) are also being studied as a treatment for bipolar depression. In addition, psychotherapy may be beneficial when added to drug treatment. Once depression has resolved, mood stabilizers are the best-proven treatments to prevent either future depression or manias. If psychotic symptoms occur during an acute depressive episode, the doctor may recommend antipsychotic medicine.

That full range of motion lets you make different sounds when you speak. It also helps you swallow and sweep away bits of food to keep your mouth clean. But for babies with tongue-tie, there's a problem with something called the lingual frenulum. That's the small stretch of tissue that connects the underside of your tongue to the bottom of your mouth. It might be too short and tight, or attached way up near the tip of the tongue. Either way, it ties the tongue in place. For some, it's not much of an issue. For others, it can lead to problems breastfeeding. Later on, it can affect eating and speaking. Doctors don't always check for it, and it's not always easy to notice. But even if your child's pediatrician doesn't find it until later, it can be treated. Usually, the lingual frenulum separates from the tongue before your baby is born. But sometimes it doesn't. Doctors aren't sure why. It may run in families. We do know that boys are 3 times more likely to get it than girls. It's often found because of problems breastfeeding. You may notice your baby: Can't latch well Tends to chew more than suck Doesn't gain weight the way you'd expect Feeds for a long time, takes a short break, then feeds for another long stretch Is fussy when trying to feed Makes a clicking sound while feeding Seems hungry all the time Along with symptoms, you may hurt during and after breastfeeding. You may also have sore or cracked nipples. But tongue-tie isn't the only reason there may be breastfeeding problems. So if you're having them, talk to your doctor. You might also notice your baby's tongue: Can't move far from side to side Can't reach the upper gums or roof of the mouth Can't stick out past the gums Has a V shape or heart shape at its tip when it's sticking out A physical exam is all it takes to see what's going on. The doctor will: Ask how feeding is going Check your child's tongue, mouth, and teeth Use a tongue depressor, which is like a big popsicle stick, to look under your child's tongue and check the range of motion The doctor may ask older kids to move their tongue around and make certain sounds, like of an r or l. Not all doctors agree on this. Some say to take care of it right away to ward off any issues. Others think it's better to wait. That's because it might not cause any problems or may loosen up over time. There's no way to know for sure what'll happen. If it's not treated, it can also lead to: Dental problems like tooth decay, swollen and irritated gums, and a gap between the lower two front teeth Gagging or choking on foods as your child starts to eat solids A hard time with basic things, like licking an ice cream cone and kissing Trouble saying d, l, n, r, s, t, th, and z sounds. Rolling an r can be especially hard. Talk it through with your doctor to learn what's best for you and your baby. There are two ways to take care of tongue-tie: Frenotomy: This basic procedure happens in a doctor's office. Sometimes you don't even need numbing drugs. The doctor takes a pair of specially cleaned scissors and clips the frenulum, which doesn't have many nerves or blood vessels. That means there's not much pain. And if there's any blood at all, it's a drop or two at most. Your baby can breastfeed right away, which can be soothing and healing. Frenuloplasty. When the frenulum is too thick for a quick snip, your pediatrician will choose this option. The doctor will: Give your child drugs so they sleep through the whole thing Use special tools to cut the frenulum Put in a few stitches that dissolve on their own as the wound heals Some hospitals may use a laser instead. In that case, your child won't need stitches. Both are usually very successful and prevent any speech, dental, or eating problems. It's rare for either one to cause any issues. As with any medical procedure though, there are risks, such as: Bleeding Damage to the tongue or the glands that make saliva Infection A frenuloplasty can also lead to scarring. And your child could have a reaction to the drugs used to help him sleep.", "question": "When should tongue-tie in babies be treated?", "answer": ["The doctor will: Ask how feeding is going Check your child's tongue, mouth, and teeth Use a tongue depressor, which is like a big popsicle stick, to look under your child's tongue and check the range of motion The doctor may ask older kids to move their tongue around and make certain sounds, like of an r or l.

If you've got pain and swelling in your joints, it could be a sign of either disease. Your doctor can set you straight, but there are some key ways to tell them apart. Lupus affects everybody differently. The way you feel may not be the same as your friend who also has the disease. Most folks will get flares, which means the condition gets worse at certain times and then gets better. The symptoms can come on slowly or suddenly, and can be permanent or temporary. Some things you may notice if you have lupus are: A rash shaped like a butterfly that covers your nose and cheeks You feel tired Pain, stiffness, or swelling in your joints Fever Sensitivity to sun or light that causes skin lesions White or blue color in your fingers and toes when you're in the cold or feel stressed Headaches or chest pain Ulcers in your mouth or nose Hair loss Low numbers of blood cells (anemia) Swelling in your hands, feet, or legs Like lupus, your symptoms sometimes get better and sometimes flare up.

If you have psoriatic arthritis you may get problems like: Severe swelling in your fingers or toes Foot pain, often at the bottom or the heel Pain in your lower back Scaly patches on your skin that flake Pitted or discolored nails It starts when your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- attacks your own organs and tissues. The disease causes inflammation and can affect different parts of your body, including your heart, skin, brain, and blood cells. Experts don't know the exact cause of lupus. They think it may be related to genes that put you at risk for lupus and things you come into contact with that trigger the disease. Some of those triggers are: Sunlight Infections Medications like blood pressure or anti-seizure drugs Psoriatic arthritis can happen if you have psoriasis, a condition that causes your skin to get red patches and silvery scales. Sometimes people get psoriasis first and then have psoriatic arthritis later, but others get the arthritis symptoms first. Like lupus, psoriatic arthritis happens when your immune system attacks your healthy cells and tissues. This causes your joints to get inflamed and your skin to make too many cells. It's not clear what causes the immune system to attack your body when you have psoriatic arthritis, but just like lupus, it's likely that genes and triggers play a role. There's no single test that shows you have lupus. Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you to get some blood and urine tests that give clues about your condition. He may also suggest you get a chest X-ray to look for fluid or inflammation in your lungs or an echocardiogram to see if you have problems with your heart. Your doctor may say you have lupus if you have at least four of 11 signs of the disease that are laid out by experts at the American College of Rheumatology: Butterfly-shaped rash Raised red patches on your skin You're sensitive to light Ulcers in your mouth or nose Arthritis in two or more joints, plus swelling or tenderness Inflammation in the lining of your heart or lungs Seizures or other nerve problems Too much protein in your urine Low blood cell counts Certain antibodies in your blood Results from a blood test called an ANA test that suggest you may have too many \"antinuclear\" antibodies, which could be a sign of lupus To check if you have psoriatic arthritis, you may need to get certain tests like X-rays to look at changes in your bones or joints, and blood tests that check for inflammation. Your doctor may also do a physical exam to see if you have inflammation and swelling in your joints or signs of psoriasis on your skin and nails. He will ask you about your medical history. Your doctor will probably rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. For example, if you only have swelling and pain in a single joint, you may have gout. And if you have no swelling, or very little, you could have osteoarthritis. Whether you have lupus or psoriatic arthritis, work with your doctor to find the right treatments for you.

Your doctor may also do a physical exam to see if you have inflammation and swelling in your joints or signs of psoriasis on your skin and nails. He will ask you about your medical history. Your doctor will probably rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. For example, if you only have swelling and pain in a single joint, you may have gout.

Try these to help keep stress in check and your diabetes under control: Recommended Related to Diabetes Scratches, Scrapes, Cuts, and Diabetes If you have diabetes, your eyes might be your best medicine when it comes to protecting your skin. Act quickly to treat any small cut, scrape, or scratch to make sure it heals properly, says James L. Roth, MD. He's a family physician in Johns Creek, GA. Check your body daily for even small wounds so you can treat them right away. â You have to keep it clean, keep it covered, and keep looking at it to see if it's getting better or getting worse,â he says. â If it's not healing within two days, if...

Starting with your toes, slowly clench one body part at a time. Hold for 5 seconds and relax. Keep going until you've tightened and relaxed every part of your body. Deep breathing. Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Then close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, filling up your lungs. Hold for a few seconds. Exhale slowly through your mouth. Let all the air out of your lungs like you're letting air out of a balloon. Repeat many times. Manage Diabetes With Stress Reduction Music. Relaxing music can ease anxiety and depression and lower your blood pressure. Find music that calms you, then put on your headphones and relax. You can make playlists of some of your favorite stress-busting songs so you have them ready when you need them. Keep them separate from the workout music that gets you pumped up to exercise. Yoga. Slowly relax into a downward dog pose or a warrior's pose. This forces you to focus on your breathing, stretching, and how you place your body. It loosens tight muscles and turns your thoughts away from the stresses in your life. Consider taking a yoga class at a gym or a local community center.

Not only does sleep give your body time to rest and recharge, it may also be crucial to your brain's ability to learn and remember. During sleep, while your body rests, your brain is busy processing information from the day and forming memories. If you are sleep deprived, you are at risk of developing a number of serious health problems, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, and your ability to learn and retain new information may be impaired. This may not be news to anyone who has pulled an all-nighter cramming for a test only to find the facts and figures they knew at 2 a.m. could not be recalled the next day. Without adequate sleep, your brain becomes foggy, your judgment poor, and your fine motor skills hindered. Imaging and behavioral studies continue to show the critical role sleep plays in learning and memory. Researchers believe that sleep affects learning and memory in two ways: Lack of sleep impairs a person's ability to focus and learn efficiently. Sleep is necessary to consolidate a memory (make it stick) so that it can be recalled in the future. There are different types of memories. Some are fact-based, such as remembering the name of state capitals. Some are episodic -- based on events in your life, such as your first kiss. And some memories are procedural or instructional, such as how to ride a bike or play the piano. For something to become a memory, three functions must occur, including: Acquisition -- learning or experiencing something new Consolidation -- the memory becomes stable in the brain Recall -- having the ability to access the memory in the future Both acquisition and recall are functions that take place when you are awake. However, researchers believe sleep is required for consolidation of a memory, no matter the memory type. Without adequate sleep, your brain has a harder time absorbing and recalling new information. Sleep does more than help sharpen the mind. Studies show that sleep affects physical reflexes, fine motor skills, and judgment, too. One study showed that participants who were sleep deprived were more likely to think they were right when they were, in fact, wrong. Studies involving memory tests show that after a single night of sleep, or even a nap, people perform better, whether on a test, in the office, on the athletic field, or in a concert hall. Scientists don't know exactly how sleep enhances memory, but it appears to involve the brain's hippocampus and neocortex -- the part of the brain where long-term memories are stored. It is thought that during sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex, where it reviews and processes memories, helping them to last for the long term. Researchers continue to investigate the stages of sleep involved in making certain types of memories. Some studies have shown that certain kinds of memories become stable during rapid eye movement ( REM) sleep -- the time when you dream. Other studies have found that some types of memories are most often secured during slow-wave, deep sleep. Scientists are getting closer to understanding what sleep does to our brain, but there are still many questions to be answered. What's certain is that sleep is a biological necessity -- we need it to survive. Unfortunately, in this day and age, few of us are able to get the sleep we need to function our best. Experts recommend adults get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Although this may not be attainable every night, it should be the goal. Here are some tips to help you get more sleep: Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. Get regular exercise, but do not exercise close to bedtime. Experts recommend allowing at least three hours between exercise and bed. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine before going to sleep. Take time to unwind before going to sleep. Take a warm bath, read a book, drink some caffeine-free tea, and avoid any activities that can cause tension. Finish eating two to three hours before going to bed. Create a pleasant sleeping environment: make the room dark, cool, and comfortable. Use a sound machine, or other type of white noise device, to block out unwanted sounds. Do not watch TV or use the computer in bed. Use your bedroom for sleep and sex only. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including getting regular and quality sleep, can be a challenge, especially when you are stressed with a work deadline or test.

Other studies have found that some types of memories are most often secured during slow-wave, deep sleep. Scientists are getting closer to understanding what sleep does to our brain, but there are still many questions to be answered. What's certain is that sleep is a biological necessity -- we need it to survive. Unfortunately, in this day and age, few of us are able to get the sleep we need to function our best. Experts recommend adults get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Although this may not be attainable every night, it should be the goal. Here are some tips to help you get more sleep: Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. Get regular exercise, but do not exercise close to bedtime. Experts recommend allowing at least three hours between exercise and bed. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine before going to sleep. Take time to unwind before going to sleep. Take a warm bath, read a book, drink some caffeine-free tea, and avoid any activities that can cause tension. Finish eating two to three hours before going to bed. Create a pleasant sleeping environment: make the room dark, cool, and comfortable. Use a sound machine, or other type of white noise device, to block out unwanted sounds. Do not watch TV or use the computer in bed. Use your bedroom for sleep and sex only. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including getting regular and quality sleep, can be a challenge, especially when you are stressed with a work deadline or test. But, remember (and you need sleep to do this! ), sleep is your friend. So, when it comes to learning and memory, sleep on it.", "question": "What are tips to help you get more sleep?", "answer": ["Here are some tips to help you get more sleep: Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day.

The 5-year survival rate for prostate cancer that has moved into nearby parts of the body is nearly 100%. Here's what you should know about your treatment and what to expect going forward. When this type of cancer spreads (your doctor may say it has metastasized), it tends to first show up in the tissues or lymph nodes that are closest to the prostate gland. If it's caught and treated in this point, which is known as \"regional\" stage, your odds or recovery are very good. If it travels further, the cancer usually ends up in your bones. At that point, the chances of survival drop to 29%. Your doctor will talk to you about your best treatment options. What you choose will largely depend on how far the cancer has spread and what symptoms, if any, you have. You may have already had surgery or radiation. Those treatments are sometimes used to target prostate cancer when it's still only in the prostate. When your cancer spreads, your doctor will most likely suggest hormone therapy. That usually means taking medication to lower the amount of androgen hormones (testosterone and DHT) in your body or prevent them from affecting cancer cells. A related but rarely used option is surgical castration. The doctor removes your testicles, where most of these hormones are made. If you don't like the idea of losing them, the doctor can fit you with silicone sacs to insert into your scrotum. They'll preserve the look and feel. If hormone therapy doesn't work, you might move on to vaccine therapy. The prostate cancer vaccine is designed to kick-start your immune system so it attacks cancer cells. Or your doctor might suggest chemotherapy. It might be a medication you take by mouth, or something your doctor injects into a vein. If prostate cancer has spread to your bones, you'll likely need medication to ease your pain, lower the risk of fractures, and keep your body's calcium levels steady. It can be dangerous if they go too high or too low. Your doctor might prescribe a drug to help keep your bones strong. You might take corticosteroids to control pain, probably along with a pain reliever. Which pain medicine you get could range from ibuprofen to morphine, depending on how bad your pain is. Your oncologist might also send you forradiation therapy in an effort to lessen bone pain and kill off cancer cells in your bones. Or he could inject you with a drug that gives off radiation. These medications are called radiopharmaceuticals. You might think you'd know it if your cancer has spread, but that's not always true. Most men with advanced prostate cancer don't have any symptoms. This is why your follow-up doctor visits are important. You're most likely to find out the cancer has spread if your doctor tests your blood and finds high levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA. He might also find it with a digital rectal exam or on an X-ray or other test. If you do have symptoms, they often include trouble peeing or blood in your urine. You might also feel very tired, short of breath, or lose weight without trying. You're more likely to feel pain if the cancer has gone into your bones. Where it hurts will depend on which bones it affects. For instance, you might feel hip or back pain if cancer has spread into your pelvic bones. No matter which treatments you decide to pursue, advanced prostate cancer is bound to take a toll on your day-to-day life.

A related but rarely used option is surgical castration. The doctor removes your testicles, where most of these hormones are made. If you don't like the idea of losing them, the doctor can fit you with silicone sacs to insert into your scrotum. They'll preserve the look and feel. If hormone therapy doesn't work, you might move on to vaccine therapy. The prostate cancer vaccine is designed to kick-start your immune system so it attacks cancer cells.

If prostate cancer has spread to your bones, you'll likely need medication to ease your pain, lower the risk of fractures, and keep your body's calcium levels steady. It can be dangerous if they go too high or too low. Your doctor might prescribe a drug to help keep your bones strong. You might take corticosteroids to control pain, probably along with a pain reliever. Which pain medicine you get could range from ibuprofen to morphine, depending on how bad your pain is. Your oncologist might also send you forradiation therapy in an effort to lessen bone pain and kill off cancer cells in your bones. Or he could inject you with a drug that gives off radiation. These medications are called radiopharmaceuticals. You might think you'd know it if your cancer has spread, but that's not always true. Most men with advanced prostate cancer don't have any symptoms. This is why your follow-up doctor visits are important. You're most likely to find out the cancer has spread if your doctor tests your blood and finds high levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA.

You might also feel very tired, short of breath, or lose weight without trying. You're more likely to feel pain if the cancer has gone into your bones.

A trip to the gym could seem like the last thing you want to do. But exercise is good for your head, and research backs this up. One study that involved 80 adults with mild to moderate major depression found that three sessions of heart-pumping activity each week for 12 weeks worked about as well as medication in fighting the symptoms of depression. The researchers also found that after 10 months, people who exercised were much less likely to relapse than people who took medicine. The results of another study showed that three to five weekly workouts that got the heart and lungs working harder cut mild to moderate symptoms of the mood disorder nearly in half. You don't have to start by signing up for a triathlon. Take simple steps to get into a new exercise routine. Start slow. If you do too much too fast, you'll probably wind up sore and discouraged. Instead, gradually work your way up. Begin by exercising for a few minutes or more on a few days of the week. Don't do more than that for a week or two. Slowly build up to 30 minutes or more, 5 days a week. Break it up. You don't have to get all of your physical activity in a single stretch or with one type of exercise. Many people prefer to do shorter workouts throughout the day, and they vary the types they do. Three 15-minute walks are as good as one 45-minute walk. Pick something you enjoy. A lot of people choose a sport not because they like it, but because they think it will be good for them. But if you treat exercise like a chore, you probably won't stick with it. Instead, try different activities until you find one or more that excite you. Maybe you can swim in a local pool, use a treadmill in front of the TV in your living room, go for hikes, or take an exercise class, for example. Get moving with other people. Solo workouts are sometimes hard to stick to. If you have a plan to do it with someone else, you might feel more committed. So find an exercise buddy. Make a date to walk with a neighbor at a set time on specific days. Or start up a regular tennis game with a friend. Many people find that structured classes, like aerobics or yoga, also help them stick with a program. Get more everyday physical activity. Work it into your daily routine whenever and wherever you can. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park a little farther away from your workplace, so you can sneak in some extra walking. Stuff your remote control under a couch cushion and get up to change the channel. Over time, good habits like these can make a big difference.", "question": "What do studies show about exercise and depression?", "answer": ["One study that involved 80 adults with mild to moderate major depression found that three sessions of heart-pumping activity each week for 12 weeks worked about as well as medication in fighting the symptoms of depression.

Where can it happen? How can you deal with it when it does? Nearly half of all people with psoriasis have nail problems. That goes up to 80% in those with psoriatic arthritis.

Try to keep your nails short. Avoid injury to them as much as you can, too. That can make things worse. For more serious problems, your doctor may give you corticosteroid injections in your nail bed. Many people with psoriasis have a fungal infection in their nails (called onychomycosis). Ask your doctor or dermatologist to see if you have it. If so, treating the fungal infection will help your nails. If you have severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, your doctor may want you to take a prescription medication that affects your whole body. That should ease nail problems, too. At least half of those with psoriasis have it here. It can cause mild scaling. That can look like and flake off like dandruff. But it's not the same. It can be severe. You can get thick, crusted patches that can cover parts or all of your scalp. It can even go past your hairline and onto your neck, ear area, and forehead. Scalp psoriasis is usually powdery looking. It may be silver in color. What you can do: Whether your condition is mild or severe, you may have to switch and combine treatments every now and then. That's because psoriasis can become resistant to a treatment after a while. If yours is mild, your dermatologist may recommend shampoos or topical solutions with tar or salicylic acid. Both lower the number of skin cells your body makes. They can ease itching, too. Your doctor may also suggest steroid scalp injections to reduce patches, or an antihistamine to deal with the itch. For more moderate to severe cases, you may get a prescription scalp ointment, liquid, cream, foam, or shampoo. Some of these have corticosteroids. If your psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis is severe and affects other areas of your body, you might be prescribed a medication that deals with all your symptoms. An example would be biologic drugs, which target specific parts of your immune system. If you notice a flare here, tell your doctor right away. It can lead to cracking, blistering, and swelling. These can be painful and raise your chances of infection. What you can do: Your first step is usually to put medicine directly on your palms and the soles of your feet. Your doctor may point you to: Tar products Salicylic acid Corticosteroid creams or ointments You'll probably have more success if you use more than one of these at a time. Your doctor may also suggest something called calcipotriene. It's a form of vitamin D. Wear cotton gloves or socks after you put it on so it can soak in without getting on other areas. If you have deep cracks in your skin, talk to your doctor about using superglue to seal them. Though this sounds odd, some dermatologists recommend it to keep cracks from getting worse. If those options don't work, you may be prescribed medicine (like methotrexate, which suppresses your immune system). He may also point you toward light therapy (also known as PUVA or UVB phototherapy). Only do that with your doctor's help. Psoriasis here is rare, but it does happen. Most of the time, patches are white or gray. They can be uncomfortable and may affect the way you talk and chew. What you can do: Talk to your doctor right away. She will probably recommend a low-potency steroid cream, like 1% hydrocortisone ointment. She may suggest a steroid-free treatment like pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, which will suppress your immune system. Psoriasis can affect your genitals. Some people only have it on their genitals. These flares are usually pink or red. They usually have little or no flaking or scaling. Psoriasis can also cause painful cracks, particularly between the buttocks.

Topical vitamin D creams and ointments are options, as are steroid creams. You'll usually get prescribed low-dose steroid creams or Eucrisa ointment (off-label, not FDA- approved) for a little while. That's because genital skin tends to be thin and steroid cream can make it even thinner. Coal tar products can irritate your genitals, so don't use them here. Don't use light therapy, either.

Most of the time, patches are white or gray. They can be uncomfortable and may affect the way you talk and chew. What you can do: Talk to your doctor right away. She will probably recommend a low-potency steroid cream, like 1% hydrocortisone ointment. She may suggest a steroid-free treatment like pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, which will suppress your immune system. Psoriasis can affect your genitals. Some people only have it on their genitals. These flares are usually pink or red. They usually have little or no flaking or scaling. Psoriasis can also cause painful cracks, particularly between the buttocks. What you can do: Treating psoriasis here can be tricky. Moisturizing regularly can help. Ask your doctor about which moisturizer is best for you. Topical vitamin D creams and ointments are options, as are steroid creams. You'll usually get prescribed low-dose steroid creams or Eucrisa ointment (off-label, not FDA- approved) for a little while. That's because genital skin tends to be thin and steroid cream can make it even thinner. Coal tar products can irritate your genitals, so don't use them here. Don't use light therapy, either. The skin on this part of your body is susceptible to skin cancer. Friction can make things worse, so think about wearing loose-fitting cotton clothing, including underwear, especially while you're sleeping.", "question": "What are the signs of psoriasis and nail problems?", "answer": ["If you have either, you might notice your nails are: Pitted, with âpockingâ or holes in the nail Thicker than normal or discolored Separated from the nail bed What you can do: You may be able to disguise mild nail changes by scraping, filing, or polishing your nails."]}

Experts believe that CRPS occurs as a result of dysfunction in the central or peripheral nervous systems. CRPS is most common in people ages 20-35. The syndrome also can occur in children; it affects women more often than men. There is no cure for CRPS. CRPS most likely does not have a single cause; rather, it results from multiple causes that produce similar symptoms. Some theories suggest that pain receptors in the affected part of the body become responsive to catecholamines, a group of nervous system messengers. In cases of injury-related CRPS, the syndrome may be caused by a triggering of the immune response, which may lead to the inflammatory symptoms of redness, warmth, and swelling in the affected area. For this reason, it is believed that CRPS may represent a disruption of the healing process. The symptoms of CRPS vary in their severity and length. One symptom of CRPS is continuous, intense pain that gets worse rather than better over time. If CRPS occurs after an injury, it may seem out of proportion to the severity of the injury. Even in cases involving an injury only to a finger or toe, pain can spread to include the entire arm or leg. In some cases, pain can even travel to the opposite extremity. Other symptoms of CRPS include: \" Burning\" pain Swelling and stiffness in affected joints Motor disability, with decreased ability to move the affected body part Changes in nail and hair growth pattern; there may be rapid hair growth or no hair growth. Skin changes; CRPS can involve changes in skin temperature -- skin on one extremity can feel warmer or cooler compared to the opposite extremity. Skin color may become blotchy, pale, purple or red. The texture of skin also can change, becoming shiny and thin. People with CRPS may have skin that sometimes is excessively sweaty. CRPS may be heightened by emotional stress. There is no specific diagnostic test for CRPS, but some testing can rule out other conditions. Triple-phase bone scans can be used to identify changes in the bone and in blood circulation. Some health care providers may apply a stimulus (for example, heat, touch, cold) to determine whether there is pain in a specific area. Making a firm diagnosis of CRPS may be difficult early in the course of the disorder when symptoms are few or mild. CRPS is diagnosed primarily through observation of the following symptoms: The presence of an initial injury A higher-than-expected amount of pain from an injury A change in appearance of an affected area No other cause of pain or altered appearance Because there is no cure for CRPS, the goal of treatment is to relieve painful symptoms associated with the disorder. Therapies used include psychotherapy, physical therapy, and drug treatment, such as topical analgesics, narcotics, corticosteroids, osteoporosis medication, antidepressants, osteoporosis medicines, and antiseizure drugs. Other treatments include: Sympathetic nerve blocks: These blocks, which are done in a variety of ways, can provide significant pain relief for some people. One kind of block involves placing an anesthetic next to the spine to directly block the sympathetic nerves. Surgical sympathectomy: This controversial technique destroys the nerves involved in CRPS. Some experts believe it has a favorable outcome, while others feel it makes CRPS worse. The technique should be considered only for people whose pain is dramatically but temporarily relieved by selective sympathetic blocks.

The purpose of clinical trials is to find new and improved methods of treating arthritis. Clinical trials make it possible to apply the latest scientific and technological advances in arthritis to patient care. During a clinical trial, doctors use the best available arthritis treatment as a standard to evaluate new treatments. The new treatments are considered to be at least as effective or possibly more effective than the standard. New treatment options are first researched in a laboratory where they are carefully studied in the test tube and in animals. Only the treatments most likely to work are further evaluated in a small group of humans prior to applying them in a larger clinical trial. When a new arthritis treatment is studied for the first time in humans, it is not known exactly how it will work. With any new treatment, there are possible risks as well as benefits. Clinical trials help doctors discover the answers to the following questions: Is the treatment safe and effective? Is the treatment potentially better than the treatments currently available? What are the side effects of the treatment? Does the treatment have any possible risks? How well does the treatment work? Clinical trials are conducted in phases, each designed to find out specific information. Each new phase of a clinical trial builds on information from previous phases. In a phase I clinical trial, the new arthritis treatment being investigated is given to a small number of participants. The researchers determine the best way to give the new treatment and how much of it can be given safely. Phase II clinical trials determine the effect of the research treatment on patients and usually the best dosage. In Phase III clinical trials, the drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used Phase IV clinical trials apply the new treatment to patient care. Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. The advantages of participating in a clinical trial include the following: You may receive a new arthritis treatment before it is widely available to the public. You can provide researchers with the information they need to continue developing new procedures and introducing new treatment methods. Your arthritis treatment costs may be decreased, since many of the tests and doctor visits that are directly related to the clinical trial are paid for by the company or agency sponsoring the study. Be sure to discuss your treatment costs with the doctors and nurses conducting the clinical trial. Potential side effects from participating in a clinical trial will depend on the type of treatment and the patient's condition. All of the risks and side effects of the treatment being researched are not known at the beginning of the clinical trial. Since this is the case, there may be unknown side effects, as well as hoped-for benefits. It's important to note that most arthritis treatments -- as well as the disease or condition itself -- have potential side effects. Patients will be informed of any known, possible side effects as well as any \"new\" side effects that occur or become known while they are participating in the trial. There are some differences in receiving arthritis treatment in a clinical trial vs. receiving regular treatment. You may receive more exams and tests than are usually given for your particular condition. The purpose of these tests is to follow your progress and collect study data. Of course, tests can carry certain benefits and risks or discomforts of their own. Although they can be inconvenient, these tests can assure an extra ounce of observation along the way. Depending on the type of clinical trial you are participating in, you may be asked to stop or change medications you are currently taking. You may also be asked to change your diet or any activities that may affect the outcome of the trial. Some clinical trials are double-blind, placebo-controlled. This means that the clinical trial participants may receive the real drug or an inactive substance that looks exactly like the drug (called a placebo). Neither the participant nor the doctor will know which drug the patient is receiving. This is done to make certain that the real drug is effective. Clinical trial participants are willing volunteers. Even though patients may be asked by their doctors to take part in a clinical trial, it is up to each patient to make the final decision. Informed consent means that as a patient, you are given all available information so you can understand what is involved in a specific clinical trial. The doctors and nurses conducting the trial will explain the treatment to you, including its possible benefits and risks. You will be given an informed consent form to read and consider carefully. Before signing, be sure you find out as much as possible about the clinical trial, including what risks you may face. Ask the doctor or nurse to explain parts of the form or the trial that are not clear. You are free to decide whether or not you want to take part in the trial. If you decide to participate, you will sign the consent form. If you do not want to participate in the trial, you may refuse to sign the consent form. If you choose not to participate in the trial, your care will not be affected in any way. Your signature on the informed consent form does not bind you to the study. Even if you sign the form, you are free to leave the trial at any time to receive other available treatments. The informed consent process is ongoing. After you agree to participate in a clinical trial, you will continue to receive any new information about your treatment that may affect your willingness to stay in the trial. Every clinical trial is designed to meet a specific set of research criteria. Each study enrolls patients with certain conditions and symptoms. If you fit the guidelines for a trial, you may be able to participate. In some instances, you may be required to undergo certain tests to confirm your acceptance. Every patient faces a new world of medical terms and procedures. Fears and myths of \"experimentation\" or \"being a guinea pig\" are common concerns of arthritis patients who are thinking about participating in a clinical trial. Even though there are always going to be fears of the unknown, understanding what is involved in a clinical trial before agreeing to participate can relieve some of your anxieties. Here's some information that may help ease your concerns: The personal information gathered about you during the clinical trial will remain confidential and will not be reported with your name attached. If at any time during the trial your doctor feels it is in your best interest to exit the trial and use other known treatments, you will be free to do so. This will not in any way affect your future arthritis treatment. Clinical trial participants typically receive their care in the same places that the standard arthritis treatments are given -- in clinics or doctors' offices. Clinical trial participants will be watched closely and data on their case will be carefully recorded and reviewed. If you are thinking about taking part in a clinical trial, find out as much as possible about the study before you decide to participate. Here are some important questions to ask: What is the purpose of the clinical trial? What kinds of tests and treatments does the clinical trial involve? How are these tests given? What is likely to happen in my case with, or without, this new research treatment? Are there standard treatment options for my arthritis, and how does the study treatment compare with them? How could the clinical trial affect my daily life? What side effects can I expect from the clinical trial? ( Note: There can also be side effects from standard arthritis treatments and from the disease itself.) How long will the clinical trial last? Will the clinical trial require extra time on my part?

In these diseases, called autoimmune diseases, the body's normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues. The body responds as if normal tissues are infected or somehow abnormal. Some, but not all, types of arthritis are the result of misdirected inflammation. Arthritis is a general term that describes inflammation in the joints. Some types of arthritis associated with inflammation include the following: Rheumatoid arthritis Psoriatic arthritis Gouty arthritis Other painful conditions of the joints and musculoskeletal system that may not be associated with inflammation include osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, muscular low back pain, and muscular neck pain. Symptoms of inflammation include: Redness Swollen joint that's sometimes warm to the touch Joint pain Joint stiffness Loss of joint function Often, only a few of these symptoms are present. Inflammation may also be associated with general flu-like symptoms including: Fever Chills Fatigue/loss of energy Headaches Loss of appetite Muscle stiffness When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body from foreign substances. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain. The increased number of cells and inflammatory substances within the joint cause irritation, swelling of the joint lining and, eventually, wearing down of cartilage (cushions at the end of bones). Inflammatory diseases are diagnosed after careful evaluation of the following: Complete medical history and physical exam with attention to: The pattern of painful joints and whether there is evidence of inflammation Presence of joint stiffness in the morning Evaluation of other symptoms Results of X-rays and blood tests Yes. Inflammation can affect organs as part of an autoimmune disorder. The type of symptoms depend on which organs are affected. For example: Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) may cause shortness of breath or fluid retention. Inflammation of the small tubes that transport air to the lungs may cause shortness of breath. Inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis) may cause high blood pressure or kidney failure. Pain may not be a primary symptom of an inflammatory disease, since many organs do not have many pain-sensitive nerves. Treatment of organ inflammation is directed at the cause of inflammation whenever possible. There are a number of treatment options for inflammatory diseases, like arthritis, including medications, rest, exercise, and surgery to correct joint damage. The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the type of disease, the person's age, type of medications he or she is taking, overall health, medical history, and severity of symptoms. The goals of treatment are the following: Correct, control, or slow down the underlying disease process Avoid or modify activities that aggravate pain Relieve pain through pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs Maintain joint movement and muscle strength through physical therapy Decrease stress on the joints by using braces, splints, or canes as needed There are many drugs available to decrease joint pain, swelling and inflammation, and possibly prevent or minimize the progression of the inflammatory disease. They are often used in combination due to their differing effects. The medications include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen) Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) Antimalarial medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) Other oral drugs known as DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), including methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide Biologic drugs such as infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, and rituximab Some of these medications are also used to treat other conditions such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, or to reduce the risk of rejection of a transplanted organ. However, when \"chemotherapy\" types of medications (such as methotrexate or cyclophosphamide) are used to treat inflammatory diseases, the doses are sometimes significantly lower and the risks of side effects tend to be less than when prescribed in higher doses for cancer treatment.

Inflammation can affect organs as part of an autoimmune disorder. The type of symptoms depend on which organs are affected. For example: Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) may cause shortness of breath or fluid retention. Inflammation of the small tubes that transport air to the lungs may cause shortness of breath. Inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis) may cause high blood pressure or kidney failure. Pain may not be a primary symptom of an inflammatory disease, since many organs do not have many pain-sensitive nerves. Treatment of organ inflammation is directed at the cause of inflammation whenever possible. There are a number of treatment options for inflammatory diseases, like arthritis, including medications, rest, exercise, and surgery to correct joint damage. The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the type of disease, the person's age, type of medications he or she is taking, overall health, medical history, and severity of symptoms. The goals of treatment are the following: Correct, control, or slow down the underlying disease process Avoid or modify activities that aggravate pain Relieve pain through pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs Maintain joint movement and muscle strength through physical therapy Decrease stress on the joints by using braces, splints, or canes as needed There are many drugs available to decrease joint pain, swelling and inflammation, and possibly prevent or minimize the progression of the inflammatory disease. They are often used in combination due to their differing effects. The medications include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen) Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) Antimalarial medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) Other oral drugs known as DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), including methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide Biologic drugs such as infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, and rituximab Some of these medications are also used to treat other conditions such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, or to reduce the risk of rejection of a transplanted organ. However, when \"chemotherapy\" types of medications (such as methotrexate or cyclophosphamide) are used to treat inflammatory diseases, the doses are sometimes significantly lower and the risks of side effects tend to be less than when prescribed in higher doses for cancer treatment.

In these diseases, called autoimmune diseases, the body's normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues. The body responds as if normal tissues are infected or somehow abnormal. Some, but not all, types of arthritis are the result of misdirected inflammation. Arthritis is a general term that describes inflammation in the joints. Some types of arthritis associated with inflammation include the following: Rheumatoid arthritis Psoriatic arthritis Gouty arthritis Other painful conditions of the joints and musculoskeletal system that may not be associated with inflammation include osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, muscular low back pain, and muscular neck pain. Symptoms of inflammation include: Redness Swollen joint that's sometimes warm to the touch Joint pain Joint stiffness Loss of joint function Often, only a few of these symptoms are present. Inflammation may also be associated with general flu-like symptoms including: Fever Chills Fatigue/loss of energy Headaches Loss of appetite Muscle stiffness When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body from foreign substances. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain.

This fluid is produced and stored in cavities in the brain called ventricles. It circulates around the brain, moving from ventricle to ventricle. The purposes of the fluid are to cushion and protect the brain and spinal cord, to supply them with nutrients, and to remove some of their waste products.

This occurs when the natural system for draining and absorbing extra CSF does not work right. The ventricles enlarge to accommodate the extra fluid and then press on different parts of the brain, causing a number of different symptoms. Hydrocephalus has many different causes. Some people are born with the condition, while others develop it during their lives. Normal pressure hydrocephalus ( NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually occurs in older adults. The average age of person with NPH is over age 60. NPH is different than other types of hydrocephalus in that it develops slowly over time. The drainage of CSF is blocked gradually, and the excess fluid builds up slowly. The slow enlargement of the ventricles means that the fluid pressure in the brain may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. However, the enlarged ventricles still press on the brain and can cause symptoms (the term \"normal pressure\" is somewhat misleading). The parts of the brain most often affected in NPH are those that control the legs, the bladder, and the \"cognitive\" mental processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, and speaking. This decline in mental processes, if it is severe enough to interfere with everyday activities, is known as dementia. Other symptoms include abnormal gait (difficulty walking), inability to hold urine (urinary incontinence), and, occasionally, inability to control the bowels. The dementia symptoms of NPH can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. Experts say that many cases of NPH are misdiagnosed as one of these diseases. The good news is that, unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. But first it must be correctly diagnosed. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can occur after a head injury, bleeding around the brain (due to a blow to the head), stroke, meningitis (infection of a protective layer of tissue around the brain), or brain tumor. It can happen after surgery on the brain. How these conditions lead to NPH is not clear. In most cases, the cause of NPH is never known. At first, the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus are usually very subtle. They worsen very gradually. Symptoms of dementia include: Memory loss Speech problems Apathy (indifference) and withdrawal Changes in behavior or mood Difficulties with reasoning, paying attention, or judgment Walking problems Unsteadiness Leg weakness Sudden falls Shuffling steps Difficulty taking the first step, as if feet were stuck to the floor \" Getting stuck\" or \"freezing\" while walking Urinary symptoms Inability to hold urine Inability to hold stool, or feces (less common) Frequent urination Urgency to urinate The following symptoms can be related to increased pressure in the brain: Headache Nausea Difficulty focusing eyes Some people think that memory loss, difficulty finding words, walking problems, or urination problems are normal parts of aging. In many cases, however, these are symptoms of treatable conditions. Any of these problems, or changes in mood or behavior, warrants a visit to your health care provider. The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus can also occur in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the combination of dementia-like symptoms, walking problems, and urinary problems should alert your health care provider to the possibility of NPH. Making the distinction is very important because the treatments for these conditions are quite different. Tests are available that can diagnose NPH. At any point in this process, your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in brain disorders (neurologist or neurosurgeon) to complete the evaluation and begin treatment. The evaluation begins with a medical interview. The medical professional will ask you questions about your symptoms and when they started, your medical and mental problems now and in the past, your family's medical problems, medications you have taken now and in the past, your work and travel experiences, and your habits and lifestyle. This is followed by a detailed physical exam to document your condition and rule out other disorders that might cause similar symptoms. The exam will probably include tests of your mental status, such as answering questions and following simple directions. Neuropsychological testing may be performed to document your dementia symptoms. Neuropsychological testing is the most accurate method of pinpointing and documenting a person's cognitive problems and strengths. Lab Tests There is no lab test that confirms the diagnosis of NPH. Any lab tests that are done are probably being done to rule out conditions that might cause similar symptoms. Imaging Tests CT scan of the head: This scan is similar to an X-ray but gives a more detailed, 3-dimensional picture of the brain. It cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH, but it can show ventricular enlargement or other changes that suggest NPH. Newer techniques can actually measure the flow of CSF in the brain. These findings alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis. This scan is safe and painless. MRI of the head : This scan uses radio signals and a strong magnet to create a detailed picture of the brain. It is safe and painless, like a CT scan, but takes longer (about 30 minutes). It also cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH. Cisternography: This test is much more involved than CT scan or MRI and is not widely used. It highlights absorption of the CSF. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This procedure involves removal of CSF from the area around the spinal cord in the lower back. The CSF pressure is measured, and the fluid that is removed is analyzed for abnormalities that might give a clue as to the problem. Usually, more fluid is removed than is necessary for these tests, the idea being that removal of a large volume of CSF may help relieve symptoms (this is checked by comparing exam results before and after). If symptoms are relieved, it is usually temporary; improvement of symptoms with lumbar puncture is commonly interpreted as meaning that a surgical shunt would be helpful in that person. Normal pressure hydrocephalus generally cannot be cured. It is a long-term condition. However, many people with the condition obtain substantial relief through surgical treatment. For those who are not candidates for surgery, treatment consists of measures to relieve mood and behavioral problems, cope with physical problems such as incontinence and walking difficulties, and maximize physical, mental, and social functioning. An individual with normal pressure hydrocephalus should always be under the care of a medical professional. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family and caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual's health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia and other symptoms of NPH. The degree of care required by people with NPH varies considerably. Those who undergo successful shunt surgery may continue to live a normal or near-normal independent life. Others will experience worsening of their symptoms over time. Many of these individuals will eventually require close supervision and care. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon should discuss with you and your family what to expect as time goes on. It's important to know that no drug or other medical treatment is known to work in NPH. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is not caused by any structural abnormality, such as a brain tumor. In most cases, the underlying problem is not known or cannot be treated. The treatment in these cases is a shunt operation. A shunt is a thin tube that is implanted in the brain by a neurosurgeon. It is inserted into the ventricles to drain excess CSF away from the brain. The tube is routed under the skin from the head to another part of the body, usually the peritoneum (the lower belly). The shunt is equipped with a valve that opens to release fluid when the pressure builds up. The fluid drains harmlessly and is later absorbed by the bloodstream. The pressure setting on the valve sometimes must be readjusted. The newer shunts allow adjustment without another operation. A shunt operation is not a cure. It does not treat the underlying cause of NPH. It can, however, relieve the symptoms. The shunt remains in place indefinitely. If properly implanted, the shunt often is not obvious to other people. Shunt operations do not work for everyone with NPH. Many people who undergo a shunt operation have substantial symptom relief. In some, the symptoms improve and then start to worsen again. Others benefit little, if at all. Even the experts are not able to predict perfectly who will benefit and who will not. Many surgeons perform a spinal tap before surgery to test whether the symptoms get better with removal of fluid. In some cases, the person is hospitalized for a few days while fluid is drained slowly through a small tube called a catheter. This is another way of checking whether removing extra fluid will help symptoms. The earlier the NPH is diagnosed, the better the chances that the surgery will help. In general, people with milder symptoms have better outcomes with this surgery. Like any surgery, the shunt operation can cause complications. Such complications include infection of the shunt and blood clots around the brain. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will discuss the pros and cons of this operation and whether it might work for you. Another operation is sometimes used instead of shunt placement. In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, an endoscope (thin tube with a lighted camera on the end) is used to create a small hole in the floor of the ventricles. The hole provides another way for CSF to drain from the brain. If you have NPH, you should have regular visits with your neurologist or neurosurgeon. These visits allow the doctor to monitor your symptoms. Changes in symptoms may require adjustments in care. There is no known way to prevent NPH. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH. NPH is a progressive condition, meaning that the symptoms gradually worsen if not treated. In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Some people improve dramatically after surgery, while others do not. Some are not candidates for surgery. Those who are not candidates for surgery have few treatment options available. Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members. The condition affects every aspect of your life, including family relationships, work, financial status, social life, and physical and mental health. You may feel overwhelmed, depressed, frustrated, angry, or resentful. These feelings do not help the situation and usually make it worse. This is why support groups were invented. Support groups are groups of people who have lived through the same difficult experiences and want to help themselves and others by sharing coping strategies.

In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Some people improve dramatically after surgery, while others do not. Some are not candidates for surgery. Those who are not candidates for surgery have few treatment options available. Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members.

This occurs when the natural system for draining and absorbing extra CSF does not work right. The ventricles enlarge to accommodate the extra fluid and then press on different parts of the brain, causing a number of different symptoms. Hydrocephalus has many different causes. Some people are born with the condition, while others develop it during their lives. Normal pressure hydrocephalus ( NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually occurs in older adults. The average age of person with NPH is over age 60. NPH is different than other types of hydrocephalus in that it develops slowly over time. The drainage of CSF is blocked gradually, and the excess fluid builds up slowly. The slow enlargement of the ventricles means that the fluid pressure in the brain may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. However, the enlarged ventricles still press on the brain and can cause symptoms (the term \"normal pressure\" is somewhat misleading). The parts of the brain most often affected in NPH are those that control the legs, the bladder, and the \"cognitive\" mental processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, and speaking. This decline in mental processes, if it is severe enough to interfere with everyday activities, is known as dementia. Other symptoms include abnormal gait (difficulty walking), inability to hold urine (urinary incontinence), and, occasionally, inability to control the bowels. The dementia symptoms of NPH can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. Experts say that many cases of NPH are misdiagnosed as one of these diseases. The good news is that, unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. But first it must be correctly diagnosed. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can occur after a head injury, bleeding around the brain (due to a blow to the head), stroke, meningitis (infection of a protective layer of tissue around the brain), or brain tumor. It can happen after surgery on the brain. How these conditions lead to NPH is not clear. In most cases, the cause of NPH is never known. At first, the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus are usually very subtle. They worsen very gradually. Symptoms of dementia include: Memory loss Speech problems Apathy (indifference) and withdrawal Changes in behavior or mood Difficulties with reasoning, paying attention, or judgment Walking problems Unsteadiness Leg weakness Sudden falls Shuffling steps Difficulty taking the first step, as if feet were stuck to the floor \" Getting stuck\" or \"freezing\" while walking Urinary symptoms Inability to hold urine Inability to hold stool, or feces (less common) Frequent urination Urgency to urinate The following symptoms can be related to increased pressure in the brain: Headache Nausea Difficulty focusing eyes Some people think that memory loss, difficulty finding words, walking problems, or urination problems are normal parts of aging. In many cases, however, these are symptoms of treatable conditions. Any of these problems, or changes in mood or behavior, warrants a visit to your health care provider. The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus can also occur in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the combination of dementia-like symptoms, walking problems, and urinary problems should alert your health care provider to the possibility of NPH. Making the distinction is very important because the treatments for these conditions are quite different. Tests are available that can diagnose NPH. At any point in this process, your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in brain disorders (neurologist or neurosurgeon) to complete the evaluation and begin treatment. The evaluation begins with a medical interview. The medical professional will ask you questions about your symptoms and when they started, your medical and mental problems now and in the past, your family's medical problems, medications you have taken now and in the past, your work and travel experiences, and your habits and lifestyle. This is followed by a detailed physical exam to document your condition and rule out other disorders that might cause similar symptoms. The exam will probably include tests of your mental status, such as answering questions and following simple directions. Neuropsychological testing may be performed to document your dementia symptoms. Neuropsychological testing is the most accurate method of pinpointing and documenting a person's cognitive problems and strengths. Lab Tests There is no lab test that confirms the diagnosis of NPH. Any lab tests that are done are probably being done to rule out conditions that might cause similar symptoms. Imaging Tests CT scan of the head: This scan is similar to an X-ray but gives a more detailed, 3-dimensional picture of the brain. It cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH, but it can show ventricular enlargement or other changes that suggest NPH. Newer techniques can actually measure the flow of CSF in the brain. These findings alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis. This scan is safe and painless. MRI of the head : This scan uses radio signals and a strong magnet to create a detailed picture of the brain. It is safe and painless, like a CT scan, but takes longer (about 30 minutes). It also cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH. Cisternography: This test is much more involved than CT scan or MRI and is not widely used. It highlights absorption of the CSF. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This procedure involves removal of CSF from the area around the spinal cord in the lower back. The CSF pressure is measured, and the fluid that is removed is analyzed for abnormalities that might give a clue as to the problem. Usually, more fluid is removed than is necessary for these tests, the idea being that removal of a large volume of CSF may help relieve symptoms (this is checked by comparing exam results before and after). If symptoms are relieved, it is usually temporary; improvement of symptoms with lumbar puncture is commonly interpreted as meaning that a surgical shunt would be helpful in that person. Normal pressure hydrocephalus generally cannot be cured. It is a long-term condition. However, many people with the condition obtain substantial relief through surgical treatment. For those who are not candidates for surgery, treatment consists of measures to relieve mood and behavioral problems, cope with physical problems such as incontinence and walking difficulties, and maximize physical, mental, and social functioning. An individual with normal pressure hydrocephalus should always be under the care of a medical professional. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family and caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual's health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia and other symptoms of NPH. The degree of care required by people with NPH varies considerably. Those who undergo successful shunt surgery may continue to live a normal or near-normal independent life. Others will experience worsening of their symptoms over time. Many of these individuals will eventually require close supervision and care. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon should discuss with you and your family what to expect as time goes on. It's important to know that no drug or other medical treatment is known to work in NPH. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is not caused by any structural abnormality, such as a brain tumor. In most cases, the underlying problem is not known or cannot be treated. The treatment in these cases is a shunt operation. A shunt is a thin tube that is implanted in the brain by a neurosurgeon. It is inserted into the ventricles to drain excess CSF away from the brain. The tube is routed under the skin from the head to another part of the body, usually the peritoneum (the lower belly). The shunt is equipped with a valve that opens to release fluid when the pressure builds up. The fluid drains harmlessly and is later absorbed by the bloodstream. The pressure setting on the valve sometimes must be readjusted. The newer shunts allow adjustment without another operation. A shunt operation is not a cure. It does not treat the underlying cause of NPH. It can, however, relieve the symptoms. The shunt remains in place indefinitely. If properly implanted, the shunt often is not obvious to other people. Shunt operations do not work for everyone with NPH. Many people who undergo a shunt operation have substantial symptom relief. In some, the symptoms improve and then start to worsen again. Others benefit little, if at all. Even the experts are not able to predict perfectly who will benefit and who will not. Many surgeons perform a spinal tap before surgery to test whether the symptoms get better with removal of fluid. In some cases, the person is hospitalized for a few days while fluid is drained slowly through a small tube called a catheter. This is another way of checking whether removing extra fluid will help symptoms. The earlier the NPH is diagnosed, the better the chances that the surgery will help. In general, people with milder symptoms have better outcomes with this surgery. Like any surgery, the shunt operation can cause complications. Such complications include infection of the shunt and blood clots around the brain. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will discuss the pros and cons of this operation and whether it might work for you. Another operation is sometimes used instead of shunt placement. In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, an endoscope (thin tube with a lighted camera on the end) is used to create a small hole in the floor of the ventricles. The hole provides another way for CSF to drain from the brain. If you have NPH, you should have regular visits with your neurologist or neurosurgeon. These visits allow the doctor to monitor your symptoms. Changes in symptoms may require adjustments in care. There is no known way to prevent NPH. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH. NPH is a progressive condition, meaning that the symptoms gradually worsen if not treated. In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Some people improve dramatically after surgery, while others do not. Some are not candidates for surgery. Those who are not candidates for surgery have few treatment options available. Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members. The condition affects every aspect of your life, including family relationships, work, financial status, social life, and physical and mental health. You may feel overwhelmed, depressed, frustrated, angry, or resentful. These feelings do not help the situation and usually make it worse. This is why support groups were invented.

At first, the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus are usually very subtle. They worsen very gradually. Symptoms of dementia include: Memory loss Speech problems Apathy (indifference) and withdrawal Changes in behavior or mood Difficulties with reasoning, paying attention, or judgment Walking problems Unsteadiness Leg weakness Sudden falls Shuffling steps Difficulty taking the first step, as if feet were stuck to the floor \" Getting stuck\" or \"freezing\" while walking Urinary symptoms Inability to hold urine Inability to hold stool, or feces (less common) Frequent urination Urgency to urinate The following symptoms can be related to increased pressure in the brain: Headache Nausea Difficulty focusing eyes Some people think that memory loss, difficulty finding words, walking problems, or urination problems are normal parts of aging. In many cases, however, these are symptoms of treatable conditions. Any of these problems, or changes in mood or behavior, warrants a visit to your health care provider. The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus can also occur in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the combination of dementia-like symptoms, walking problems, and urinary problems should alert your health care provider to the possibility of NPH. Making the distinction is very important because the treatments for these conditions are quite different. Tests are available that can diagnose NPH. At any point in this process, your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in brain disorders (neurologist or neurosurgeon) to complete the evaluation and begin treatment. The evaluation begins with a medical interview. The medical professional will ask you questions about your symptoms and when they started, your medical and mental problems now and in the past, your family's medical problems, medications you have taken now and in the past, your work and travel experiences, and your habits and lifestyle. This is followed by a detailed physical exam to document your condition and rule out other disorders that might cause similar symptoms. The exam will probably include tests of your mental status, such as answering questions and following simple directions. Neuropsychological testing may be performed to document your dementia symptoms. Neuropsychological testing is the most accurate method of pinpointing and documenting a person's cognitive problems and strengths. Lab Tests There is no lab test that confirms the diagnosis of NPH. Any lab tests that are done are probably being done to rule out conditions that might cause similar symptoms. Imaging Tests CT scan of the head: This scan is similar to an X-ray but gives a more detailed, 3-dimensional picture of the brain. It cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH, but it can show ventricular enlargement or other changes that suggest NPH. Newer techniques can actually measure the flow of CSF in the brain. These findings alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis. This scan is safe and painless. MRI of the head : This scan uses radio signals and a strong magnet to create a detailed picture of the brain. It is safe and painless, like a CT scan, but takes longer (about 30 minutes). It also cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH. Cisternography: This test is much more involved than CT scan or MRI and is not widely used. It highlights absorption of the CSF. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This procedure involves removal of CSF from the area around the spinal cord in the lower back. The CSF pressure is measured, and the fluid that is removed is analyzed for abnormalities that might give a clue as to the problem. Usually, more fluid is removed than is necessary for these tests, the idea being that removal of a large volume of CSF may help relieve symptoms (this is checked by comparing exam results before and after). If symptoms are relieved, it is usually temporary; improvement of symptoms with lumbar puncture is commonly interpreted as meaning that a surgical shunt would be helpful in that person. Normal pressure hydrocephalus generally cannot be cured. It is a long-term condition. However, many people with the condition obtain substantial relief through surgical treatment. For those who are not candidates for surgery, treatment consists of measures to relieve mood and behavioral problems, cope with physical problems such as incontinence and walking difficulties, and maximize physical, mental, and social functioning. An individual with normal pressure hydrocephalus should always be under the care of a medical professional. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family and caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual's health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia and other symptoms of NPH. The degree of care required by people with NPH varies considerably. Those who undergo successful shunt surgery may continue to live a normal or near-normal independent life. Others will experience worsening of their symptoms over time. Many of these individuals will eventually require close supervision and care. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon should discuss with you and your family what to expect as time goes on. It's important to know that no drug or other medical treatment is known to work in NPH. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is not caused by any structural abnormality, such as a brain tumor. In most cases, the underlying problem is not known or cannot be treated. The treatment in these cases is a shunt operation. A shunt is a thin tube that is implanted in the brain by a neurosurgeon. It is inserted into the ventricles to drain excess CSF away from the brain. The tube is routed under the skin from the head to another part of the body, usually the peritoneum (the lower belly). The shunt is equipped with a valve that opens to release fluid when the pressure builds up. The fluid drains harmlessly and is later absorbed by the bloodstream. The pressure setting on the valve sometimes must be readjusted. The newer shunts allow adjustment without another operation. A shunt operation is not a cure. It does not treat the underlying cause of NPH. It can, however, relieve the symptoms. The shunt remains in place indefinitely. If properly implanted, the shunt often is not obvious to other people. Shunt operations do not work for everyone with NPH. Many people who undergo a shunt operation have substantial symptom relief. In some, the symptoms improve and then start to worsen again. Others benefit little, if at all. Even the experts are not able to predict perfectly who will benefit and who will not. Many surgeons perform a spinal tap before surgery to test whether the symptoms get better with removal of fluid. In some cases, the person is hospitalized for a few days while fluid is drained slowly through a small tube called a catheter. This is another way of checking whether removing extra fluid will help symptoms. The earlier the NPH is diagnosed, the better the chances that the surgery will help. In general, people with milder symptoms have better outcomes with this surgery. Like any surgery, the shunt operation can cause complications. Such complications include infection of the shunt and blood clots around the brain. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will discuss the pros and cons of this operation and whether it might work for you. Another operation is sometimes used instead of shunt placement. In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, an endoscope (thin tube with a lighted camera on the end) is used to create a small hole in the floor of the ventricles. The hole provides another way for CSF to drain from the brain. If you have NPH, you should have regular visits with your neurologist or neurosurgeon. These visits allow the doctor to monitor your symptoms. Changes in symptoms may require adjustments in care. There is no known way to prevent NPH. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH. NPH is a progressive condition, meaning that the symptoms gradually worsen if not treated. In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Some people improve dramatically after surgery, while others do not. Some are not candidates for surgery. Those who are not candidates for surgery have few treatment options available. Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members. The condition affects every aspect of your life, including family relationships, work, financial status, social life, and physical and mental health. You may feel overwhelmed, depressed, frustrated, angry, or resentful. These feelings do not help the situation and usually make it worse. This is why support groups were invented. Support groups are groups of people who have lived through the same difficult experiences and want to help themselves and others by sharing coping strategies. Support groups meet in person, on the telephone, or on the Internet. To find a support group that works for you, contact the organizations listed below.

This fluid is produced and stored in cavities in the brain called ventricles. It circulates around the brain, moving from ventricle to ventricle.

This occurs when the natural system for draining and absorbing extra CSF does not work right. The ventricles enlarge to accommodate the extra fluid and then press on different parts of the brain, causing a number of different symptoms. Hydrocephalus has many different causes. Some people are born with the condition, while others develop it during their lives. Normal pressure hydrocephalus ( NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually occurs in older adults. The average age of person with NPH is over age 60. NPH is different than other types of hydrocephalus in that it develops slowly over time. The drainage of CSF is blocked gradually, and the excess fluid builds up slowly. The slow enlargement of the ventricles means that the fluid pressure in the brain may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. However, the enlarged ventricles still press on the brain and can cause symptoms (the term \"normal pressure\" is somewhat misleading). The parts of the brain most often affected in NPH are those that control the legs, the bladder, and the \"cognitive\" mental processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, and speaking. This decline in mental processes, if it is severe enough to interfere with everyday activities, is known as dementia. Other symptoms include abnormal gait (difficulty walking), inability to hold urine (urinary incontinence), and, occasionally, inability to control the bowels. The dementia symptoms of NPH can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. Experts say that many cases of NPH are misdiagnosed as one of these diseases. The good news is that, unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. But first it must be correctly diagnosed. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can occur after a head injury, bleeding around the brain (due to a blow to the head), stroke, meningitis (infection of a protective layer of tissue around the brain), or brain tumor.

The good news is that most of kidney cancers are found before they spread (metastasize) to distant organs. And cancers caught early are easier to treat successfully.

They lie in your lower abdomen on each side of your spine. Their main job is to clean your blood, removing waste products and making urine. Doctors don't know the causes of kidney cancer. But certain factors appear to increase the risk of getting kidney cancer. For example, kidney cancer occurs most often in people older than age 40. These are some other risk factors for kidney cancer: Smoking . If you smoke cigarettes, your risk for kidney cancer is twice that of nonsmokers. Smoking cigars may also increase your risk. Being male. Men are about twice as likely as women to get kidney cancer. Being obese. Extra weight may cause changes to hormones that increase your risk. Using certain pain medications for a long time. This includes over-the-counter drugs in addition to prescription drugs. Having advanced kidney disease or being on long-term dialysis, a treatment for people with kidneys that have stopped working Having certain genetic conditions, such as von Hippel- Lindau ( VHL) disease or inherited papillary renal cell carcinoma Having a family history of kidney cancer. The risk is especially high in siblings. Being exposed to certain chemicals, such as asbestos, cadmium, benzene, organic solvents, or certain herbicides Having high blood pressure. Doctors don't know whether high blood pressure or medication used to treat it is the source of the increased risk. Being black. The risk in blacks is slightly higher than in whites. No one knows why. Having lymphoma. For an unknown reason, there is an increased risk of kidney cancer in patients with lymphoma. Having these risk factors does not mean you will get kidney cancer. And it's also true that you can have none of them and still get the disease. In many cases, people may have no early symptoms of kidney cancer. As the tumor grows larger, symptoms may appear. You may have one or more of these kidney cancer symptoms: Blood in your urine A lump in your side or abdomen A loss of appetite A pain in your side that doesn't go away Weight loss that occurs for no known reason Fever that lasts for weeks and isn't caused by a cold or other infection Extreme fatigue Anemia Swelling in your ankles or legs Kidney cancer that spreads to other parts of your body may cause other symptoms, such as: Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Bone pain Maybe you've had kidney cancer symptoms such as pain in your side, weight loss, or extreme fatigue. Or maybe your doctor has found a lump in your side during a routine exam or a sign of kidney cancer during a test for another disease. Regardless, to confirm a diagnosis of kidney cancer, you will need a thorough physical exam, health history, and tests. Your doctor will feel your abdomen and side for lumps and check for fever and high blood pressure, among other things. You will also answer questions about your health habits, any past illnesses, and types of treatment. To make a diagnosis of kidney cancer, your doctor will also order one or more tests like these: Urine tests check for blood in your urine or other signs of problems. Blood tests show how well your kidneys are working. Intravenous pyelogram ( IVP) involves X-raying your kidneys after the doctor injects a dye that travels to your urinary tract, highlighting any tumors. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your kidneys. It can help tell if a tumor is solid or fluid-filled. A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create a series of detailed pictures of your kidneys. This may also require an injection of dye. CT scans have virtually replaced pyelogram and ultrasound as a tool for diagnosing kidney cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues in your body. You may need an injection of a contrast agent to create better pictures. Renal arteriogram. This test is used to evaluate the blood supply to the tumor. It is not given often, but may help diagnose small tumors. It has other uses, as well. Unlike with many other cancers, your doctor may be pretty certain about a diagnosis of kidney cancer without a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy will be done to confirm the diagnosis. A doctor may use a needle biopsy to remove a sample of tissue, which is then examined under a microscope for cancer cells. The biopsy may also tell the grade of the cancer -- how aggressive the cancer is likely to be. Often the surgeon will simply remove the entire tumor and then have a sample of tissue examined. Once your doctor makes a diagnosis of kidney cancer, you may need other tests to tell if the cancer has spread within your kidney, to the other kidney, or to other parts of your body. When cancer spreads from the place where it first started, it has metastasized. You might need a CT scan or MRI. A chest X-ray can show whether the cancer has spread to your lungs. A bone scan can see if it is in your bones. These tests will help your doctor determine the stage of kidney cancer. Your prognosis depends on your general health, as well as the grade and stage of your kidney cancer. These are the stages of kidney cancer. The higher the stage, the more advanced the cancer. Stage I A tumor 7 centimeters or smaller that is only in the kidney Stage II A tumor larger than 7 centimeters that is only in the kidney Stage III A tumor that is in the kidney and in at least one nearby lymph node A tumor that is in the kidney's main blood vessel and may also be in nearby lymph node A tumor that is in the fatty tissue around the kidney and may also involve nearby lymph nodes A tumor that extends into major veins or perinephric tissues, but not into the ipsilateral adrenal gland and not beyond Gerota's fascia Stage IV Cancer has spread beyond the fatty layer of tissue around the kidney, and it may also be in nearby lymph nodes Cancer may have spread to other organs, such as the bowel, pancreas, or lungs Cancer has spread beyond Gerota's fascia (including contiguous extension into the ipsilateral adrenal gland) Once you have a diagnosis and know your stage of kidney cancer, you and your doctor can plan treatment. You may want to gather information to help you feel more informed about your decision. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist for treatment. This could include an urologist, a medical or radiation oncologist, or a surgeon. Before beginning treatment, many people find it helpful to get a second opinion about the diagnosis of kidney cancer and the treatment plan. Kidney cancer is one of the more common cancers to undergo spontaneous regression, in which it may return to an eralier stage. However, the incidence is quite low (approximately 0.5%). There are several standard types of treatment for kidney cancer. In most cases, surgery is the first step. Even if surgery removes the entire tumor, though, your doctor may suggest an extra treatment to kill any remaining cancer cells that can't be seen. Surgery for kidney cancer These are the main types of surgery for kidney cancer. Which type you have depends on how advanced your cancer is. Radical nephrectomy removes the kidney, adrenal gland, and surrounding tissue. It also often removes nearby lymph nodes. It is the most common surgery for kidney cancer and can now be done through a small incision with a laparoscope. Simple nephrectomy removes the kidney only. Partial nephrectomy removes the cancer in the kidney along with some tissue around it. This procedure is used for patients with smaller tumors (less than 4 cm) or in those patients in which a radical nephrectomy might hurt the other kidney. You can survive with just a part of one kidney as long as it is still working. If the surgeon removes both kidneys or if both kidneys are not working, you will need a machine to clean your blood (dialysis) or a new kidney (kidney transplant). A transplant is possible if your cancer was found only in your kidney and a donated kidney is available. If surgery can't remove your kidney cancer, your doctor may suggest another option to help destroy the tumor. Cryotherapy uses extreme cold to kill the tumor. Radiofrequency ablation uses high-energy radio waves to \"cook\" the tumor. Arterial embolization involves inserting material into an artery that leads to the kidney. This blocks blood flow to the tumor. This procedure may be done to help shrink the tumor before surgery. Biologic therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses your immune system to fight cancer by boosting, directing, or restoring your body's natural defenses. Substances for biologic therapy are made by your body or in a lab. Examples of biologic therapy for metastatic kidney cancer include interferon alpha or interleukin-2. There are many new immunotherapies being actively studied for kidney cancer. Targeted therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses drugs or other substances to find and target cancer cells with less toxicity to normal cells. One type of targeted therapy is anti-angiogenic agents. These keep blood vessels from feeding a tumor, causing it to shrink or stop growing. Another type of targeted agent is known as multikinase inhibitors or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These are oral drugs that block an enzyme pathway which allows cancer cells to grow. A third type of targeted therapy is known as m- TOR inhibitors. There are two of these drugs available, one oral and one by IV. They block a pathway which allows blood vessels to help tumor cells grow. Each of these drugs has a unique place in the management of advanced kidney cancer. Radiation therapy for kidney cancer Often used to help with symptoms of kidney cancer or in patients who cannot have surgery, this treatment uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or halt their growth. External radiation therapy sends radiation to the cancer from a machine outside the body. Chemotherapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells or stop them from multiplying. Less effective for kidney cancer than for other types of cancer, chemotherapy is mostly used for a certain type of kidney cancer in which there spindle cells (sarcomatoid variant). Because doctors don't know the causes of kidney cancer, it is not clear how to prevent the disease. However, certain factors are linked to kidney cancer, so you can take certain steps to lower your risk -- quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight, manage your blood pressure, and avoid being exposed to harmful chemicals.", "question": "What is biologic therapy for kidney cancer?", "answer": ["Biologic therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses your immune system to fight cancer by boosting, directing, or restoring your body's natural defenses.

All laser vision correction surgeries work by reshaping the cornea, the clear front part of the eye, so that light traveling through it is properly focused onto the retina located in the back of the eye. LASIK is one of a number of different surgical techniques used to reshape the cornea. LASIK has many benefits, including: It has been around for over 25 years and it works! It corrects vision. Around 96% of patients will have their desired vision after LASIK. An enhancement can further increase this number. LASIK is associated with very little pain due to the numbing drops that are used. Vision is corrected nearly by the day after LASIK. No bandages or stitches are required after LASIK. Adjustments can be made years after LASIK to further correct vision if vision changes while you age. After having LASIK, most patients have a dramatic reduction in eyeglass or contact lens dependence and many patients no longer need them at all. Despite the pluses, there are some disadvantages to LASIK eye surgery: LASIK is technically complex. Rare problems may occur when the doctor creates the flap, which can permanently affect vision. This is one reason to choose a surgeon who is very experienced at performing these surgeries. LASIK can rarely cause a loss of \"best\" vision. Your best vision is the highest degree of vision that you achieved while wearing your contacts or eyeglasses. Some patients experience discomfort in the first 24 to 48 hours after LASIK eye surgery. Other side effects, although rare, may include: Glare Seeing halos around images Difficulty driving at night Fluctuating vision Dry eyes Before LASIK eye surgery, you will meet with a coordinator or eye surgeon who will discuss what to expect during and after the procedure. During this session, your medical history will be evaluated and your eyes will be fully examined. Likely initial tests include measuring corneal thickness, refraction, corneal mapping, eye pressure, and pupil dilation. Once you have gone through the initial evaluation, you will meet the surgeon, who will answer any questions you may have. Afterwards, you can schedule an appointment for the procedure. If you wear rigid gas permeable contact lenses, you should not wear them for at least three weeks before your evaluation. Other types of contact lenses shouldn't be worn for at least three days prior to the evaluation. Be sure to bring your eyeglasses to the surgeon so your prescription can be reviewed. On the day of your surgery, eat a light meal before going to the doctor and take all of your prescribed medications. Do not wear eye makeup or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you are not feeling well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the procedure needs to be postponed. During LASIK eye surgery, an instrument called a microkeratome or femtosecond laser is used to create a thin flap in the cornea. The cornea flap is then painlessly peeled back and the underlying corneal tissue is reshaped using another laser. After the cornea is reshaped so that it can properly focus light onto the retina, the cornea flap is put back in place and the surgery is complete. LASIK is performed while the patient is under local anesthesia in the form of eye drops (no shots, no needles) and usually takes about 10 minutes to complete. Patients may also request mild sedation. Plan to have someone drive you home after surgery. Your eyes will temporarily be dry even though they do not feel that way. Your doctor will give you prescription eye drops to prevent infection and inflammation and eyedrops to keep your eyes moist. These drops may cause a momentary slight burn or blurring of your vision when you use them. Do not use any eye drops not approved by your eye doctor. Healing after LASIK eye surgery usually occurs very rapidly. Vision may be blurry and hazy for the first day, but most patients notice improved vision within a few days of surgery.

Healing after LASIK eye surgery usually occurs very rapidly. Vision may be blurry and hazy for the first day, but most patients notice improved vision within a few days of surgery. Specific follow-up after the surgery varies from one surgeon to another. You will revisit the doctor for an evaluation 24 to 48 hours after LASIK eye surgery, as well as at regular intervals within the first six months.", "question": "How should I prepare on the day of my LASIK eye surgery?", "answer": ["On the day of your surgery, eat a light meal before going to the doctor and take all of your prescribed medications. Do not wear eye makeup or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you are not feeling well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the procedure needs to be postponed."]}

One thing that hasn't changed, though, is the fact that many kids who wet the bed feel a deep sense of shame and embarrassment about their problem, which can contribute to low self-esteem. The good news is that there are things you can do as a parent to help minimize the negative emotional effects of bedwetting, also known as eneuresis. Many children wet the bed until they're about 6 years old and then stop, with no need to seek medical treatment. But if your child is older than 6 or if the bedwetting problem is causing you or your child concern, it's a good idea to visit your pediatrician. The doctor can do a series of tests to rule out abnormalities that might be causing the problem, and help put your child's mind at ease about bedwetting. Sometimes, knowing that bedwetting is a medical problem treated by doctors can help alleviate a child's shame or embarrassment. You and your child can discuss that you're going to address bedwetting the same way you would address a sore throat or sprained ankle, for example. Your child may feel like she's doing something wrong if she wets the bed, so you and the doctor can let her know that it's not her fault. It can be useful to explain to children who wet the bed that enuresis is often caused by a slightly delayed development of the bladder and the nerves that interact with it. You can also talk about the fact that many kids who wet the bed sleep so soundly, they fail to wake up when they need to go to the bathroom. Bedwetting isn't something kids talk about with each other, so your child might feel like he's the only kid his age who still wets the bed. Be sure to tell him that millions of children, and teenagers too, regularly wet their beds. In fact, it's quite likely that he knows someone else with a bedwetting problem -- he just doesn't know it. Bedwetting often runs in families, too. Children whose parents did not wet the bed have a 15% chance of being bedwetters, which goes up to 44% if one parent wet the bed and rises all the way to 77% if both parents wet the bed as children. So, if you or your partner wet the bed when you were young, share this information with your child. Telling them you had the same problem can minimize the embarrassment he feels and give him hope that he will get over the problem. Chances are your child is already very upset and ashamed for having wet the bed again last night. And, believe it or not, he didn't do it on purpose. No matter how tempted you are to get mad, it's important for you to stay calm and positive. In fact, punishing your child for wetting the bed can actually make the problem worse, and damage your relationship with your child. One of the best things you can do to help your bedwetting child's self-esteem is to encourage him and give him hope that he'll overcome the problem. Similarly, be sure to give your child accolades for waking up dry whenever it happens. If your child has siblings, be sure they know that teasing about bedwetting is not allowed. Your goal is to have your child get up to use the bathroom in the night if she needs to, so make sure she feels comfortable doing so. It can be helpful to tell her it's OK to go to the bathroom in the night. For children who are afraid of the dark, placing nightlights in the hallway and the bathroom can make it less scary to venture to the bathroom during the night. To help your child get used to using the bathroom in the night, it might be helpful for you to wake her up at first to help instill the habit. Just as you don't want to overemphasize bedwetting, it's important that you don't ignore it entirely, either. It can give you child a sense of empowerment and help with the embarrassment if you encourage him to help you clean up and assist with the laundry when bedwetting does occur, if he's old enough. It may be helpful to layer the bed with sheets and absorbable pads in between layers. Each morning, or in the middle of the night, the child can remove the wet layer and reveal a dry layer underneath. This may minimize laundry and facilitate the chore of making the bed. Many children who wet the bed despair of ever getting over their problem, which can send their self-esteem into a downward spiral. Interestingly, it's not uncommon for children to stop wetting the bed shortly after they visit a specialist and realize there are things that can be done to stop bedwetting. There are a number of different ways you can help your child take some ownership of his bedwetting recovery, which will instill confidence and a sense of hope. First, work with your child to create and keep a bedwetting calendar or journal. Your child can recognize dry nights with stars and even come up with different hypotheses to test. For instance, they might decide to test whether limiting soda in the evening helps minimize bedwetting occurrences and keep track of it in their bedwetting journal. You can also encourage your child to visualize his bladder filling up overnight and imagine himself waking up to use the bathroom when he needs to urinate. Working with your child to use a bedwetting alarm -- a device that is worn and makes noise to wake the child when it gets wet -- can also help your child feel like he is doing something to stop wetting the bed. You might want to compare your child's active involvement in addressing bedwetting to something you do for a problem you have, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising to lose weight, or wearing glasses to help you see better.", "question": "Why is it important to give your child a sense of control over bedwetting to help minimize the negative emotional effects of it?", "answer": ["There are a number of different ways you can help your child take some ownership of his bedwetting recovery, which will instill confidence and a sense of hope.

Plan ahead and learn what to do before, during, and after pregnancy to make your next 9 months a little easier. Talk to your doctor. Let her know you want to have a baby.

You'll need to stop taking them at least 1 month before you start trying. Time it right. Just like any woman, you might not get pregnant right away. To limit the time you're off your medicine, try to learn your âfertility window.â That's the time of the month when you're most likely to conceive. You can buy an ovulation kit at the drugstore to help you figure it out. Your doctor can recommend other ways to help your timing, too. Build a support team.

That's because pregnancy naturally protects many women from new flares, especially after the first 3 months. So enjoy it! Focus on getting the right foods, exercise, and plenty of rest. Watch out for urinary tract infections ( UTIs). They are more common for pregnant women with MS. Drink lots of water, and tell your doctor if you feel burning when you go to the bathroom or if your urine is cloudy or smelly. You may get monthly urine tests to check for UTIs.

Prepare for your special delivery. Chances are you'll be able to give birth just like any other woman.

Think carefully about breastfeeding. If you go back on your meds, you won't be able to do it. The drugs could harm your baby through your milk. But if your doctor says it's OK to wait to take your medicine, breastfeed if you want to. It's perfectly safe for you and great for your little one.

You'll need to stop taking them at least 1 month before you start trying. Time it right. Just like any woman, you might not get pregnant right away. To limit the time you're off your medicine, try to learn your âfertility window.â That's the time of the month when you're most likely to conceive. You can buy an ovulation kit at the drugstore to help you figure it out. Your doctor can recommend other ways to help your timing, too. Build a support team. MS can wear you out, and pregnancy can, too. Don't be afraid to ask family and friends to fix meals or help around the house so you can save your energy. Make sure your team is ready to pitch in after the baby comes, too. Expect some relief. You may get a break from your MS symptoms. That's because pregnancy naturally protects many women from new flares, especially after the first 3 months. So enjoy it! Focus on getting the right foods, exercise, and plenty of rest. Watch out for urinary tract infections ( UTIs). They are more common for pregnant women with MS. Drink lots of water, and tell your doctor if you feel burning when you go to the bathroom or if your urine is cloudy or smelly. You may get monthly urine tests to check for UTIs. You also may have trouble with constipation. A stool softener can get things moving. Prop yourself up. As you get bigger, your balance may be off. Use a cane or other walking aid so you don't fall. Prepare for your special delivery. Chances are you'll be able to give birth just like any other woman. If you can't push because of fatigue or muscle weakness, your doctor may use special tools to help you deliver naturally. Or you might need a C-section. You might not know when labor starts if you have lost feeling in your pelvis. In that case, your doctor will watch you more closely during the last month. She may want to use drugs or other procedures to put you in labor. Medicines to block pain, including injections called epidurals, are safe for people with MS. If you want one, tell your doctor. Be aware of flares. In the first 9 months after birth, up to 40% of women with MS will have a relapse. But a flare doesn't raise your risk of a long-term disability. If you had many flares before pregnancy, you may be more likely to have one now. It may be a good idea to start taking your MS medicine right away to help stop one. Think carefully about breastfeeding. If you go back on your meds, you won't be able to do it. The drugs could harm your baby through your milk. But if your doctor says it's OK to wait to take your medicine, breastfeed if you want to. It's perfectly safe for you and great for your little one. Store the milk you pump in the fridge so your partner can tackle middle-of-the night feedings. You need your rest now more than ever. Don't feel guilty if you choose medication over breastfeeding. After all, your new addition needs a mom who can stay healthy. Mind your mood. Women with MS have a higher risk of depression during pregnancy and especially right after they give birth. Call your doctor if you start to notice any symptoms, like feeling sad or hopeless. Your ob-gyn may also screen you for depression during a routine prenatal or postpartum visit. Your doctor can help treat your depression symptoms. Will your baby grow up to have MS? It's a common concern for many parents-to-be.

It happens to about 1% of all men and 15% of infertile men. There aren't really any symptoms that you'd notice, but if you've been trying to get your partner pregnant without success, this condition could be the cause. You might have a problem that keeps your testicles from making sperm or that stops sperm from getting out of your body. There are three main types of azoospermia: Pretesticular azoospermia: Your testicles are normal, but your body can't get them to make sperm. It might happen because of low hormone levels or after you've had chemotherapy. This type is pretty rare. Testicular azoospermia: Damage to your testicles keeps them from making sperm normally. It can happen because of: An infection in your reproductive tract, such as epididymitis and urethritis A childhood illness such as viral orchitis, which causes swelling of one or both testicles A groin injury Cancer or its treatments, like radiation Genetic conditions, such as Klinefelter's syndrome Post-testicular azoospermia: Your testicles make normal sperm, but something keeps them from getting out, like: A blockage in the tubes that carry sperm from your testicles to your penis. This is called obstructive azoospermia. A vasectomy Retrograde ejaculation, when semen goes into your bladder instead of out of your penis during an orgasm About 40% of men with azoospermia have the post-testicular type. If you've been trying without luck to get your partner pregnant, your doctor might check you for this condition. First, you'll give samples of your semen, and a lab will examine them with a high-powered microscope. If the results show no sperm in your semen on two separate occasions, then you've got azoospermia. Your doctor will then try to figure out what's causing the problem. She'll give you a complete physical exam, ask you about your medical history, and test your blood to measure your hormone levels. If your hormone levels are normal, your doctor may order a scrotal or transrectal ultrasound to look for an obstruction. A MRI may confirm the diagnosis. Sometimes, surgery is the only way to find the obstruction. If you don't have a blockage, genetic tests can find out if you have a problem in your genes. There are a few types of treatment that can help men with azoospermia who want to have children. If you have the obstructive type, surgery can remove the blockage. The more recent your blockage, the more likely it is that the surgery will be successful. Sperm retrieval can help men with nonobstructive azoospermia or those who have a blockage but don't want surgery. One way to do this is to use a tiny needle to draw sperm from a testicle. Then, you can freeze the sample to use later in in vitro fertilization ( IVF). If you have a testicular biopsy, your doctor can retrieve sperm at the same time, so you won't need a second surgery.", "question": "What are the causes of testicular azoospermia?", "answer": ["Testicular azoospermia: Damage to your testicles keeps them from making sperm normally.

It's rare, but some people have NSCLC with â ALK rearrangement.â Understanding what that means can help you better manage your health. It will also make it easier to talk to your doctors about your care and treatment. Here's what you need to know. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a gene that tells your body how to make proteins that help cells talk to each other. If you have lung cancer with an ALK rearrangement, part of this gene is broken and attached to another gene. Doctors call changes in genes like this mutations. This one boosts your odds of several types of cancers, including lung cancer. You may hear your doctor call it ALK-positive. Staging means how far the cancer has spread to other body parts. Knowing this helps your doctor plan your treatment options. The higher the stage number, the more the widespread your cancer is. Stage IV is the most advanced form. It means the disease has spread to distant parts of your body, such as your liver or brain. This type is very hard to cure. More than half of the people who have lung cancer don't find out until the disease is in later stages. So if you have symptoms, see a doctor. Lung cancer may not cause problems until you've had it long enough for it to spread to other parts of your body. But talk to your doctor if you have: A cough that doesn't go away Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing Hoarseness Weight loss without trying and loss of appetite Coughing up blood Shortness of breath A weak or tired feeling Wheezing When cancer spreads, as it has by the time it gets to stage IV, it can cause: Bone pain Problems related to your brain and nerves, like headaches, weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures Yellowed eyes or skin Lumps near the surface of your skin If you have non-small-cell lung cancer, your doctor should test you for the ALK genetic mutation. This will help find the best treatment for you. Most doctors use a test called FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Your doctor will take a sample of the tumor during a process called a biopsy and send it to a lab. Scientists will check the tumor's DNA for signs of the gene mix-up. This test doesn't check your DNA makeup. That means it can't tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You'll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. And he might take another biopsy. If you get surgery to remove the tumor, the surgeon might find cancer that didn't show up on other tests. Yes. Medicines called ALK inhibitors are the main kind. These drugs block the abnormal ALK protein and shrink lung tumors linked to it. Your doctor might call this âtargeted therapyâ because it zooms in on the cancer cells and disrupts their growth. You should only take these drugs if a FISH test shows you have the mutation. These drugs won't cure you, but they should improve quality of life. ALK inhibitors include alectinib ( Alecensa), brigatinib ( Alunbrig), ceritinib ( Zykadia), crizotinib ( Xalkori), and lorlatinib ( Lorbrena). These are pills that you take once or twice a day. After a few years, the medicine may stop working. This is called resistance. If this happens, or if the cancer spreads, you may need to switch to another ALK inhibitor. Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. The most common include: Diarrhea Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Blurry vision These side effects are usually mild, but not always. Stomach problems tend to be more severe with ceritinib. In rare cases, some people have to stop taking the drug. A small number of people get pneumonitis, an inflammation of the tissue in the walls of the lungs. It can be life-threatening. If you get it, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking the drug. Before you take these drugs, your doctor should do an EKG to test your heart. ALK inhibitors have been linked to changes in the heartbeat or heart rate that aren't explained by other health problems or medications. Your doctor might start you on chemotherapy before you get tested for the ALK rearrangement. If you're ALK-positive and already on chemo, some experts say you should stick with it for several cycles -- as long as you can handle it and the cancer doesn't spread. If the cancer does spread, your doctor may switch you to an ALK inhibitor. This depends on how far your cancer has spread. If it has reached your brain, your doctor might suggest surgery or radiation. But newer ALK inhibitors are helping to reduce this need. Your doctor will prescribe other treatments to keep you as comfortable as possible. These often include: Medicines to ease your pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms Procedures to remove fluid buildup from around your lungs to help you breathe better Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms so you get the right treatments. This also depends on the stage of your cancer. Your health care team will let you know how often you should come in for checkups. Keep all your appointments so your doctors can keep up with how you feel and how well your treatment is working. He may order regular follow-up tests, like: Blood work Lung tests Imaging tests to take pictures of the inside of your body, like CT scans or chest X-rays Scientists are looking for new ways to fight lung cancer. A clinical trial may be a good option if what you're doing isn't working, especially if you have stage IV cancer. Ask your doctor about any clinical trials for ALK-positive lung cancer. Clinicaltrials.gov is another good place to try. Try typing \" ALK-positive lung cancer\" in the search box. Remember, you're at the heart of your health care team. Taking a proactive approach to care and treatment can help you feel more in control. Deciding on the right treatment for cancer is a personal choice. It's OK to ask questions if you're not sure how a medicine or therapy might affect you, and to tell your doctor how you're really doing -- physically and emotionally. It's normal to have strong feelings when you're dealing with cancer.

Lung cancer may not cause problems until you've had it long enough for it to spread to other parts of your body. But talk to your doctor if you have: A cough that doesn't go away Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing Hoarseness Weight loss without trying and loss of appetite Coughing up blood Shortness of breath A weak or tired feeling Wheezing When cancer spreads, as it has by the time it gets to stage IV, it can cause: Bone pain Problems related to your brain and nerves, like headaches, weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures Yellowed eyes or skin Lumps near the surface of your skin If you have non-small-cell lung cancer, your doctor should test you for the ALK genetic mutation. This will help find the best treatment for you. Most doctors use a test called FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Your doctor will take a sample of the tumor during a process called a biopsy and send it to a lab. Scientists will check the tumor's DNA for signs of the gene mix-up. This test doesn't check your DNA makeup. That means it can't tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You'll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. And he might take another biopsy. If you get surgery to remove the tumor, the surgeon might find cancer that didn't show up on other tests. Yes. Medicines called ALK inhibitors are the main kind. These drugs block the abnormal ALK protein and shrink lung tumors linked to it. Your doctor might call this âtargeted therapyâ because it zooms in on the cancer cells and disrupts their growth. You should only take these drugs if a FISH test shows you have the mutation. These drugs won't cure you, but they should improve quality of life. ALK inhibitors include alectinib ( Alecensa), brigatinib ( Alunbrig), ceritinib ( Zykadia), crizotinib ( Xalkori), and lorlatinib ( Lorbrena). These are pills that you take once or twice a day. After a few years, the medicine may stop working. This is called resistance. If this happens, or if the cancer spreads, you may need to switch to another ALK inhibitor. Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. The most common include: Diarrhea Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Blurry vision These side effects are usually mild, but not always. Stomach problems tend to be more severe with ceritinib. In rare cases, some people have to stop taking the drug. A small number of people get pneumonitis, an inflammation of the tissue in the walls of the lungs. It can be life-threatening. If you get it, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking the drug. Before you take these drugs, your doctor should do an EKG to test your heart. ALK inhibitors have been linked to changes in the heartbeat or heart rate that aren't explained by other health problems or medications. Your doctor might start you on chemotherapy before you get tested for the ALK rearrangement. If you're ALK-positive and already on chemo, some experts say you should stick with it for several cycles -- as long as you can handle it and the cancer doesn't spread. If the cancer does spread, your doctor may switch you to an ALK inhibitor. This depends on how far your cancer has spread. If it has reached your brain, your doctor might suggest surgery or radiation. But newer ALK inhibitors are helping to reduce this need. Your doctor will prescribe other treatments to keep you as comfortable as possible. These often include: Medicines to ease your pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms Procedures to remove fluid buildup from around your lungs to help you breathe better Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms so you get the right treatments. This also depends on the stage of your cancer. Your health care team will let you know how often you should come in for checkups.

He may order regular follow-up tests, like: Blood work Lung tests Imaging tests to take pictures of the inside of your body, like CT scans or chest X-rays Scientists are looking for new ways to fight lung cancer. A clinical trial may be a good option if what you're doing isn't working, especially if you have stage IV cancer. Ask your doctor about any clinical trials for ALK-positive lung cancer. Clinicaltrials.gov is another good place to try. Try typing \" ALK-positive lung cancer\" in the search box. Remember, you're at the heart of your health care team. Taking a proactive approach to care and treatment can help you feel more in control. Deciding on the right treatment for cancer is a personal choice. It's OK to ask questions if you're not sure how a medicine or therapy might affect you, and to tell your doctor how you're really doing -- physically and emotionally. It's normal to have strong feelings when you're dealing with cancer.

It's rare, but some people have NSCLC with â ALK rearrangement.â Understanding what that means can help you better manage your health. It will also make it easier to talk to your doctors about your care and treatment. Here's what you need to know. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a gene that tells your body how to make proteins that help cells talk to each other. If you have lung cancer with an ALK rearrangement, part of this gene is broken and attached to another gene. Doctors call changes in genes like this mutations. This one boosts your odds of several types of cancers, including lung cancer. You may hear your doctor call it ALK-positive. Staging means how far the cancer has spread to other body parts. Knowing this helps your doctor plan your treatment options. The higher the stage number, the more the widespread your cancer is. Stage IV is the most advanced form. It means the disease has spread to distant parts of your body, such as your liver or brain. This type is very hard to cure. More than half of the people who have lung cancer don't find out until the disease is in later stages. So if you have symptoms, see a doctor. Lung cancer may not cause problems until you've had it long enough for it to spread to other parts of your body. But talk to your doctor if you have: A cough that doesn't go away Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing Hoarseness Weight loss without trying and loss of appetite Coughing up blood Shortness of breath A weak or tired feeling Wheezing When cancer spreads, as it has by the time it gets to stage IV, it can cause: Bone pain Problems related to your brain and nerves, like headaches, weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures Yellowed eyes or skin Lumps near the surface of your skin If you have non-small-cell lung cancer, your doctor should test you for the ALK genetic mutation. This will help find the best treatment for you. Most doctors use a test called FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Your doctor will take a sample of the tumor during a process called a biopsy and send it to a lab. Scientists will check the tumor's DNA for signs of the gene mix-up. This test doesn't check your DNA makeup. That means it can't tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You'll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. And he might take another biopsy. If you get surgery to remove the tumor, the surgeon might find cancer that didn't show up on other tests. Yes. Medicines called ALK inhibitors are the main kind. These drugs block the abnormal ALK protein and shrink lung tumors linked to it. Your doctor might call this âtargeted therapyâ because it zooms in on the cancer cells and disrupts their growth. You should only take these drugs if a FISH test shows you have the mutation. These drugs won't cure you, but they should improve quality of life. ALK inhibitors include alectinib ( Alecensa), brigatinib ( Alunbrig), ceritinib ( Zykadia), crizotinib ( Xalkori), and lorlatinib ( Lorbrena). These are pills that you take once or twice a day. After a few years, the medicine may stop working. This is called resistance. If this happens, or if the cancer spreads, you may need to switch to another ALK inhibitor. Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. The most common include: Diarrhea Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Blurry vision These side effects are usually mild, but not always. Stomach problems tend to be more severe with ceritinib. In rare cases, some people have to stop taking the drug. A small number of people get pneumonitis, an inflammation of the tissue in the walls of the lungs. It can be life-threatening. If you get it, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking the drug. Before you take these drugs, your doctor should do an EKG to test your heart. ALK inhibitors have been linked to changes in the heartbeat or heart rate that aren't explained by other health problems or medications. Your doctor might start you on chemotherapy before you get tested for the ALK rearrangement. If you're ALK-positive and already on chemo, some experts say you should stick with it for several cycles -- as long as you can handle it and the cancer doesn't spread. If the cancer does spread, your doctor may switch you to an ALK inhibitor. This depends on how far your cancer has spread. If it has reached your brain, your doctor might suggest surgery or radiation. But newer ALK inhibitors are helping to reduce this need. Your doctor will prescribe other treatments to keep you as comfortable as possible. These often include: Medicines to ease your pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms Procedures to remove fluid buildup from around your lungs to help you breathe better Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms so you get the right treatments. This also depends on the stage of your cancer. Your health care team will let you know how often you should come in for checkups.

He may order regular follow-up tests, like: Blood work Lung tests Imaging tests to take pictures of the inside of your body, like CT scans or chest X-rays Scientists are looking for new ways to fight lung cancer. A clinical trial may be a good option if what you're doing isn't working, especially if you have stage IV cancer. Ask your doctor about any clinical trials for ALK-positive lung cancer.

Taking a proactive approach to care and treatment can help you feel more in control. Deciding on the right treatment for cancer is a personal choice. It's OK to ask questions if you're not sure how a medicine or therapy might affect you, and to tell your doctor how you're really doing -- physically and emotionally.

It's rare, but some people have NSCLC with â ALK rearrangement.â Understanding what that means can help you better manage your health. It will also make it easier to talk to your doctors about your care and treatment. Here's what you need to know. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a gene that tells your body how to make proteins that help cells talk to each other. If you have lung cancer with an ALK rearrangement, part of this gene is broken and attached to another gene. Doctors call changes in genes like this mutations. This one boosts your odds of several types of cancers, including lung cancer. You may hear your doctor call it ALK-positive. Staging means how far the cancer has spread to other body parts. Knowing this helps your doctor plan your treatment options. The higher the stage number, the more the widespread your cancer is. Stage IV is the most advanced form. It means the disease has spread to distant parts of your body, such as your liver or brain. This type is very hard to cure. More than half of the people who have lung cancer don't find out until the disease is in later stages. So if you have symptoms, see a doctor. Lung cancer may not cause problems until you've had it long enough for it to spread to other parts of your body. But talk to your doctor if you have: A cough that doesn't go away Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing Hoarseness Weight loss without trying and loss of appetite Coughing up blood Shortness of breath A weak or tired feeling Wheezing When cancer spreads, as it has by the time it gets to stage IV, it can cause: Bone pain Problems related to your brain and nerves, like headaches, weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures Yellowed eyes or skin Lumps near the surface of your skin If you have non-small-cell lung cancer, your doctor should test you for the ALK genetic mutation. This will help find the best treatment for you. Most doctors use a test called FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Your doctor will take a sample of the tumor during a process called a biopsy and send it to a lab. Scientists will check the tumor's DNA for signs of the gene mix-up. This test doesn't check your DNA makeup. That means it can't tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You'll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. And he might take another biopsy. If you get surgery to remove the tumor, the surgeon might find cancer that didn't show up on other tests. Yes. Medicines called ALK inhibitors are the main kind. These drugs block the abnormal ALK protein and shrink lung tumors linked to it. Your doctor might call this âtargeted therapyâ because it zooms in on the cancer cells and disrupts their growth. You should only take these drugs if a FISH test shows you have the mutation. These drugs won't cure you, but they should improve quality of life. ALK inhibitors include alectinib ( Alecensa), brigatinib ( Alunbrig), ceritinib ( Zykadia), crizotinib ( Xalkori), and lorlatinib ( Lorbrena). These are pills that you take once or twice a day. After a few years, the medicine may stop working. This is called resistance. If this happens, or if the cancer spreads, you may need to switch to another ALK inhibitor. Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. The most common include: Diarrhea Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Blurry vision These side effects are usually mild, but not always. Stomach problems tend to be more severe with ceritinib. In rare cases, some people have to stop taking the drug. A small number of people get pneumonitis, an inflammation of the tissue in the walls of the lungs. It can be life-threatening. If you get it, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking the drug. Before you take these drugs, your doctor should do an EKG to test your heart. ALK inhibitors have been linked to changes in the heartbeat or heart rate that aren't explained by other health problems or medications. Your doctor might start you on chemotherapy before you get tested for the ALK rearrangement. If you're ALK-positive and already on chemo, some experts say you should stick with it for several cycles -- as long as you can handle it and the cancer doesn't spread. If the cancer does spread, your doctor may switch you to an ALK inhibitor. This depends on how far your cancer has spread. If it has reached your brain, your doctor might suggest surgery or radiation. But newer ALK inhibitors are helping to reduce this need. Your doctor will prescribe other treatments to keep you as comfortable as possible. These often include: Medicines to ease your pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms Procedures to remove fluid buildup from around your lungs to help you breathe better Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms so you get the right treatments. This also depends on the stage of your cancer. Your health care team will let you know how often you should come in for checkups. Keep all your appointments so your doctors can keep up with how you feel and how well your treatment is working. He may order regular follow-up tests, like: Blood work Lung tests Imaging tests to take pictures of the inside of your body, like CT scans or chest X-rays Scientists are looking for new ways to fight lung cancer. A clinical trial may be a good option if what you're doing isn't working, especially if you have stage IV cancer. Ask your doctor about any clinical trials for ALK-positive lung cancer. Clinicaltrials.gov is another good place to try. Try typing \" ALK-positive lung cancer\" in the search box. Remember, you're at the heart of your health care team. Taking a proactive approach to care and treatment can help you feel more in control. Deciding on the right treatment for cancer is a personal choice. It's OK to ask questions if you're not sure how a medicine or therapy might affect you, and to tell your doctor how you're really doing -- physically and emotionally. It's normal to have strong feelings when you're dealing with cancer.

But for some people, they happen a lot more. Fortunately, treatment can do a lot to stop them. Doctors generally treat panic attacks by setting people up with psychological therapy, medication, or both. Whichever route you and your doctor take, it will need time to work, so try to be patient. When people follow through with their treatment plan, the overwhelming majority of them find relief and have no permanent problems. The racing heartbeat or other discomforts that go with an attack can resemble other illnesses, such as heart disease. So your doctor will probably start by giving you a complete physical exam. That way, she can make sure that the symptoms aren't coming from a disease you didn't know about. If no medical condition like that shows up, your doctor may send you to talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist trained to recognize when someone has been having panic attacks. Your doctor will combine the counselor's input with her own observations to diagnose what's wrong. When someone has attacks repeatedly, doctors call the condition panic disorder. The treatment may begin with âtalk therapy.â You'll sit down with a counselor who can help you understand what panic disorder is and how you can manage it. As your treatment continues, therapy should help you figure out the situations, thoughts, or feelings that cause your attacks. Once you understand what's happening, those triggers have less power to cause trouble. Counseling should also show you that the attacks' physical effects don't actually hurt you. With your therapist, you'll work through your symptoms in a safe, gradual way until they seem less scary. That also can help make the attacks go away. You'll also learn relaxation techniques that can help you handle attacks when they do happen. If you can control your breathing, for instance, that may make a panic attack less severe. It might also make the next one less likely. You have to practice these skills regularly in your daily life to get the benefit. Your doctor may decide that medication should be part of your therapy, to lessen your attacks' physical symptoms. It might be part of the first steps, for instance. She might prescribe: An antidepressant, which is generally the first choice to prevent future panic attacks. An anti-anxiety prescription drug such as a benzodiazepine. For people with substance use disorders, doctors may prescribe other medications. Medicine to even out an irregular heartbeat, if you have one. You and your doctor may have to try more than one medication before finding what works best. Some people do best with more than one type. In addition to your treatment, you may also find that these everyday habits make a difference: Yoga or deep breathing may relax your body and lower stress. Exercise can help calm your mind and offset potential side effects of medication, such as weight gain. Stay away from alcoholic drinks, caffeine, smoking, and recreational drugs, which can trigger attacks. Get enough sleep, so you don't feel draggy during the day. Some research shows that acupuncture, the Chinese technique of inserting thin needles into the body to control the flow of energy, may help. As for dietary supplements, there's not enough research showing that they work to reduce panic attacks. One, called inositol, showed some promise in small studies, but it's too soon to know how well it works. Be sure to check with your doctor before trying any supplements, because they could have side effects or conflict with medication. While you're working to get better, it helps to have people around you to help. If you join a support group, you could draw strength and encouragement from others who face the same challenges. Your loved ones can pitch in, too. Health professionals more and more recommend treatment programs that include spouses, partners, or families. For instance, the people around you can help you practice relaxation techniques or other skills. If you're a friend or family member of someone who's dealing with panic attacks, be patient with them. Never scold or judge. Learn their signs of stress, so you can watch for them and be a calming influence. If your loved one does have a panic attack, stay calm and help them get whatever aid they need. Conquering panic attacks takes time. If you have weekly therapy sessions, you should start to notice results in 10 to 20 weeks. Some studies show improvement after just 12 weeks. After a year, you should feel a huge improvement.

The racing heartbeat or other discomforts that go with an attack can resemble other illnesses, such as heart disease. So your doctor will probably start by giving you a complete physical exam. That way, she can make sure that the symptoms aren't coming from a disease you didn't know about. If no medical condition like that shows up, your doctor may send you to talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist trained to recognize when someone has been having panic attacks. Your doctor will combine the counselor's input with her own observations to diagnose what's wrong. When someone has attacks repeatedly, doctors call the condition panic disorder. The treatment may begin with âtalk therapy.â You'll sit down with a counselor who can help you understand what panic disorder is and how you can manage it. As your treatment continues, therapy should help you figure out the situations, thoughts, or feelings that cause your attacks. Once you understand what's happening, those triggers have less power to cause trouble. Counseling should also show you that the attacks' physical effects don't actually hurt you. With your therapist, you'll work through your symptoms in a safe, gradual way until they seem less scary. That also can help make the attacks go away. You'll also learn relaxation techniques that can help you handle attacks when they do happen. If you can control your breathing, for instance, that may make a panic attack less severe. It might also make the next one less likely. You have to practice these skills regularly in your daily life to get the benefit. Your doctor may decide that medication should be part of your therapy, to lessen your attacks' physical symptoms. It might be part of the first steps, for instance. She might prescribe: An antidepressant, which is generally the first choice to prevent future panic attacks. An anti-anxiety prescription drug such as a benzodiazepine. For people with substance use disorders, doctors may prescribe other medications. Medicine to even out an irregular heartbeat, if you have one. You and your doctor may have to try more than one medication before finding what works best. Some people do best with more than one type. In addition to your treatment, you may also find that these everyday habits make a difference: Yoga or deep breathing may relax your body and lower stress. Exercise can help calm your mind and offset potential side effects of medication, such as weight gain. Stay away from alcoholic drinks, caffeine, smoking, and recreational drugs, which can trigger attacks. Get enough sleep, so you don't feel draggy during the day. Some research shows that acupuncture, the Chinese technique of inserting thin needles into the body to control the flow of energy, may help. As for dietary supplements, there's not enough research showing that they work to reduce panic attacks. One, called inositol, showed some promise in small studies, but it's too soon to know how well it works. Be sure to check with your doctor before trying any supplements, because they could have side effects or conflict with medication. While you're working to get better, it helps to have people around you to help. If you join a support group, you could draw strength and encouragement from others who face the same challenges. Your loved ones can pitch in, too. Health professionals more and more recommend treatment programs that include spouses, partners, or families. For instance, the people around you can help you practice relaxation techniques or other skills. If you're a friend or family member of someone who's dealing with panic attacks, be patient with them. Never scold or judge. Learn their signs of stress, so you can watch for them and be a calming influence. If your loved one does have a panic attack, stay calm and help them get whatever aid they need. Conquering panic attacks takes time. If you have weekly therapy sessions, you should start to notice results in 10 to 20 weeks. Some studies show improvement after just 12 weeks. After a year, you should feel a huge improvement. It all depends on sticking with the treatment plan that you and your medical team create.

Ultrasound testing uses sound waves to make a picture of internal organs. During the procedure, a small ultrasound device is installed on the tip of an endoscope. An endoscope is a small, lighted, flexible tube with a camera attached. By inserting the endoscope and camera into the upper or the lower digestive tract, the doctor is able to obtain high-quality ultrasound images of organs. Because the EUS can get close to the organ(s) being examined, the images obtained with EUS are often more accurate and detailed than images provided by traditional ultrasound which must travel from the outside of the body. Endoscopic ultrasound may be used to: Evaluate stages of cancer. Evaluate chronic pancreatitis or other disorders of the pancreas. Study abnormalities or tumors in organs, including the gallbladder and liver. Study the muscles of the lower rectum and anal canal to determine reasons forfecalincontinence(accidental bowel leakage). Study nodules (bumps) in the intestinal wall. A person undergoing an endoscopic ultrasound will be sedated prior to the procedure. After sedation, the doctor inserts an endoscope into the person's mouth or rectum. The doctor will observe the inside of the intestinal tract on a TV monitor and the ultrasound image on another monitor. Additionally the sound wave testing may be used to locate and help take biopsies (small piece of tissue to examine by microscope). The entire procedure usually takes 30 to 90 minutes and the patient usually can go home the same day of the procedure.", "question": "When is endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) used?", "answer": ["Endoscopic ultrasound may be used to: Evaluate stages of cancer.

The breast MRI should not be used in lieu of a breast biopsy to distinguish between benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) areas. Due to false positive results, this test may increase the number of breast biopsies that need to be performed. Although MRI may detect tumors in dense breast tissue, the presence of dense breast tissue is not a reason to have a breast MRI scan. Breast MRI scanning cannot detect tiny specks of calcium (known as microcalcifications), which account for half of the cancers detected by mammography. Talk to your doctor about whether you should have an MRI of the breasts. A breast MRI is safe. The test poses no risk to the average patient if appropriate safety guidelines are followed. People who have had heart surgery and people with the following medical devices can be safely examined with MRI: Surgical clips or sutures Artificial joints Staples Most heart valve replacements Disconnected medication pumps Vena cava filters Brain shunt tubes for hydrocephalus Some conditions may make an MRI exam inadvisable.

In most cases, the procedure takes 45 to 60 minutes, during which time several dozen images are obtained. Before a breast MRI, personal items such as your watch, jewelry, and wallet -- including any credit cards with magnetic strips (they will be erased by the magnet) -- should be left at home or removed. Hearing aids should be removed before the test, because they can be damaged by the magnetic field. Secured lockers are typically available to store personal possessions. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown during your breast MRI. As the MRI scan begins, you will hear the equipment making a muffled thumping sound that will last for several minutes. Other than the sound, you should experience no unusual sensations during the scanning. Certain MRI exams require that you receive an injection of a contrast material known as gadolinium. This helps identify certain anatomic structures on the scan images. Feel free to ask questions or tell the technologist or your doctor if you have any concerns.

In most cases, the procedure takes 45 to 60 minutes, during which time several dozen images are obtained. Before a breast MRI, personal items such as your watch, jewelry, and wallet -- including any credit cards with magnetic strips (they will be erased by the magnet) -- should be left at home or removed. Hearing aids should be removed before the test, because they can be damaged by the magnetic field. Secured lockers are typically available to store personal possessions. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown during your breast MRI. As the MRI scan begins, you will hear the equipment making a muffled thumping sound that will last for several minutes. Other than the sound, you should experience no unusual sensations during the scanning. Certain MRI exams require that you receive an injection of a contrast material known as gadolinium. This helps identify certain anatomic structures on the scan images. Feel free to ask questions or tell the technologist or your doctor if you have any concerns.

And because he's still developing in your uterus, his immune system most likely won't be able to fight it off. If the disease stays in his body, his organs might not develop correctly. How sick your baby can get depends on several things, including what the condition is and how far along he is in his development. But a number of problems can happen -- from jaundice (yellowish skin or eyes) and hearing problems to miscarriage and stillbirth. Toxoplasmosis is rare and it's caused by a parasite. The parasite usually gets into your body through your mouth, so you can get the disease from eating foods such as undercooked meat. If you're infected, you can pass the infection on to your unborn baby. Problems your baby can have if he's exposed to toxoplasmosis include: Brain damage Inflammation of parts of the eye, which can cause blindness Delays in ability to use muscles (motor) and other development Seizures Too much fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) To lower your chances of getting toxoplasmosis: Don't eat undercooked meat or raw eggs. Keep away from cat litter and cat poop. Avoid insects, such as flies, that have been around cat poop. Among the other agents included in TORCH syndrome are HIV, fifth disease, syphilis, and varicella zoster virus. HIV. Almost all U. S. children under age 13 who have HIV got it from their mothers during pregnancy. If you are HIV-positive, tests might not show that your baby has it at birth, but it can show up later, even after he is 6 months old. He might have symptoms like delayed growth, pneumonia, or swollen lymph nodes and abdomen. If you have HIV and are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, anti-retroviral medications can help lower your chances of passing the virus on to your baby. Syphilis. Pregnant women in the first or second stage of this sexually transmitted disease ( STD) pass it to their babies 75% of the time if it's not treated. Syphilis is caused by bacteria and can create serious problems during a baby's development. Many babies who get it before birth won't survive full term, or will die shortly after they're born. Almost half of babies will be stillborn. Babies born with syphilis can have misshaped bones, anemia, meningitis, skin rashes, and nerve problems that can cause blindness and deafness. If you're pregnant, you should be tested for syphilis. If you test positive, your doctor can treat it with antibiotics. Fifth disease. This disease is caused by parvovirus B19. It's seldom a problem for pregnant women or their babies. About half of women are immune to the virus, so their babies won't get fifth disease. Those babies that do can get anemia. Less than 5% of the time, women have problems that cause them to miscarry. Since there's no vaccine or medication to prevent fifth disease, it's important to wash your hands with soap and water often, and avoid being around sick people. If you're pregnant, talk to your doctor about the risks. Varicella. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella zoster virus, and it also causes congenital varicella syndrome in babies. It's unlikely you would pass varicella on to your baby. Even if you have chickenpox while you're pregnant, there's still only a 2% chance you'll pass it on. However, babies born with congenital varicella can have birth defects. If you've never had chickenpox and never been vaccinated, you should get vaccinated at least a month before you plan to get pregnant. And tell your doctor if you think you've been exposed to chickenpox while pregnant. Rubella, which also is known as German measles, is a contagious disease caused by a virus. If you get rubella, you'll likely have a low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash. If you're pregnant and get rubella in your first trimester, it's likely that you'll pass it on to your baby. It can be very serious -- you could have a miscarriage, or your baby could have severe birth defects. The first 3 months of your pregnancy is when rubella can cause the most problems in your baby's development. That's why it's important to tell your doctor right away if you think you might have gotten it. Because of the measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR) vaccine, the disease is rare in children. There are only about 30 to 60 known cases of it each year in the United States, and fewer than five babies a year are born with it. There's no cure for congenital rubella syndrome, so prevention is key. If you're thinking of becoming pregnant and you haven't already had the MMR vaccine, you should get it at least 28 days before you conceive. Also known as CMV, cytomegalovirus is an infection in the herpes virus group. And it's estimated that 50% of adults have it by the time they're 30. There is no cure for CMV, but it gets better on its own very quickly and doesn't cause serious problems -- unless you're pregnant. If you're pregnant, you can pass it to your unborn child. In fact, CMV is the most common viral infection passed on to babies in the U. S. -- about 1 in 150 births. About 1 in 5 babies born with congenital CMV will get sick or have long-term issues from it, including: Hearing and vision loss Jaundice Small birth size Lung problems Seizures Muscle weakness Mental disabilities Like CMV, herpes is a lifelong infection, but it can be inactive for periods of time. It's also very common â more than 50% of people in the U. S. have it by the time they reach their 20s. There are two kinds of herpes: HSV-1, which can causes blisters around the mouth, but can also be passed to the genitals. HSV-2 is an STD that causes genital herpes, and can cause blisters or open sores on the genitals or anus. It can also cause oral herpes. You can pass herpes to your baby in several ways: He can get the virus while he's in the uterus. This is rare. You could have a genital outbreak during delivery. This is the most common way babies are infected. He can also get herpes while he is a newborn. The greatest risk to your baby is if you get your first outbreak of herpes while you're pregnant. That's because during your first outbreak, you shed more particles of the virus and for a longer period of time. Your body has fewer antibodies to fight the virus than it will during future outbreaks. If you're pregnant and get herpes later in your pregnancy, the chances of passing it on to your baby could be higher. Talk to your doctor about your concerns. If you have an active outbreak when it's time to deliver your baby, it may be best for you to have a C-section, and you may need to take other precautions.", "question": "What is TORCH syndrome?", "answer": ["TORCH syndrome may sound like a single illness, but actually it stands for a group of infectious diseases that can cause problems -- some serious -- for your unborn baby: Toxoplasmosis Other agents (including HIV, syphilis, varicella, and fifth disease) Rubella Cytomegalovirus Herpes simplex If you get one of the TORCH infections while you're pregnant, and it spreads through your blood to your baby, he can get it, too."]}

The area to be removed doesn't control a critical function like language, sensation, or movement. If you meet those standards, it works best when: Your seizures are disabling. Medication doesn't control your seizures. Drug side effects are severe and affect your quality of life. People with other serious medical problems, like cancer or heart disease, usually aren't considered for this treatment. The type of surgery you get depends on the type of seizures you have and where in your brain they start. Lobe resection. The largest part of your brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four sections called lobes: the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Temporal lobe epilepsy, in which the seizure focus is within your temporal lobe, is the most common type in teens and adults. In a temporal lobe resection, brain tissue in this area is cut away to remove the seizure focus. Extratemporal resection involves removing brain tissue from areas outside of the temporal lobe. Lesionectomy. This surgery removes brain lesions -- areas of injury or defect like a tumor or malformed blood vessel -- that cause seizures. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed. Corpus callosotomy. The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers connecting the two halves (called hemispheres) of your brain. In this operation, which is sometimes called split-brain surgery, your doctor cuts the corpus callosum. This stops communication between the hemispheres and prevents the spread of seizures from one side of your brain to the other. It works best for people with extreme forms of uncontrollable epilepsy who have intense seizures that can lead to violent falls and serious injury. Functional hemispherectomy. In a hemispherectomy, the doctor removes an entire hemisphere -- or half of your brain. In a functional hemispherectomy, the doctor leaves the hemisphere in place but disconnects it from the rest of your brain. He only removes a limited area of brain tissue. This surgery is mostly for children younger than 13 who have one hemisphere that doesn't work the way it should. Multiple subpial transection ( MST). This procedure can help control seizures that begin in areas of your brain that can't be safely removed. The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts (he'll call them transections) in your brain tissue. These cuts interrupt the flow of seizure impulses but don't disturb normal brain activity. That leaves your abilities intact. Vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS). A device put under your skin sends an electronic jolt to the vagus nerve, which controls activity between your brain and major internal organs. It lowers seizure activity in some people with partial seizures. Responsive neurostimulation device ( RNS). Doctors put a small neurostimulator in your skull, just under your scalp. They link it to one or two wires (called electrodes) that they place either in the part of your brain where the seizures start or on your brain's surface. The device detects abnormal electrical activity in the area and sends an electric current. It can stop the process that leads to a seizure. Deep brain stimulation. Doctors put electrodes into a specific area of the brain. They directly stimulate the brain to help stop the spread of seizures in adults who have not responded to medication and aren't candidates for other surgeries. It depends on the type of surgery. Some people are completely free of seizures after surgery. Others still have seizures, but less often. You'll need to keep taking anti-seizure medication for a year or more afterward. Once your doctor knows your seizures are under control, you may be able to cut back on meds or stop taking them. Before you have surgery, your doctor will discuss the pros and cons with you. Some risks are: Infection and bleeding, as well as the chance of an allergic reaction to the anesthesia. These are common with any operation. Making existing problems worse or creating new trouble with the way your brain works. You could lose vision, speech, memory, or movement. A return of seizures. If you have a seizure right after surgery, your doctor may suggest a second surgery (called a reoperation). This doesn't mean the operation didn't work. It usually means your surgeon didn't remove all the brain tissue that causes seizures.", "question": "What lesionectomy surgery for epilepsy?", "answer": ["This surgery removes brain lesions -- areas of injury or defect like a tumor or malformed blood vessel -- that cause seizures.

While medications can help you manage them, there can be side effects. That's why some people with migraines like to go âall naturalâ to find relief. The good news is there is some evidence these supplements, which include things like vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes, may help. But the science is limited. Remember, âall naturalâ doesn't necessarily mean safe. Any supplement you take should be discussed with your doctor.

It seems that people with migraines have lower levels of magnesium than the rest of us. Magnesium is naturally found in foods like spinach, nuts, and whole grains. It helps control blood pressure and blood sugar, and your muscles and nerves need it to work properly. Researchers have tested magnesium supplements for treating and preventing migraines. So far, the results are mixed. If you want to try it, you should take about 400 milligrams each day. You have to take it for at least 3 months to know whether it works for you. Too much magnesium from supplements can bring side effects including: Nausea Cramping Diarrhea Magnesium supplements can also interfere with some antibiotics. Better known as vitamin B2, this may make migraines less frequent and less severe for some people. It's found naturally in foods like: Meat Eggs Milk Green veggies Nuts Enriched flour And like many of the other B vitamins, it's also found in daily vitamin pills. Riboflavin plays a key role in metabolism, the process by which our bodies make energy. Research has shown that people with migraines may have a glitch in that process. That glitch could be responsible for the headaches. Riboflavin is considered most likely safe for most people, but it can turn your urine an orange color. To help prevent migraines, you should take about 400 milligrams of riboflavin a day. That's much more than what is in a multivitamin. Don't take more multivitamins to get that much riboflavin. You'd also be taking too much of everything else in that vitamin. And that can cause problems. Taking more than 400 milligrams every day probably won't do you more good. If you're taking antibiotics, specifically tetracycline antibiotics, riboflavin may interfere with them. This plant, which looks like a daisy, has a long history in treating -- you guessed it -- fevers, as well as aches and pains due to inflammation. Research shows that feverfew may treat and prevent migraines. But most results have been mixed. None of the studies showed that feverfew caused any serious side effects. If you want to try it, start at a low dose of about 50 milligrams a day. It may take a few months to see any results. Don't take feverfew if you take an anticoagulant drug. Like riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, sometimes called co Q10, is a part of metabolism. Foods like liver, whole grains, and oily fish like salmon are the primary food sources for this vitamin. Some studies do show it may help prevent migraines. In one small study, people with migraines were given coenzyme Q10 each day. More than 60% of them had a 50% drop in the number of days they had a migraine. Co Q10 doesn't have many major side effects, though you could get an upset stomach or nausea. Doses higher than 300 milligrams daily may affect your liver. And if you take the anticoagulant warfarin, co Q10 may make it less effective. You may have popped some melatonin to get a good night's rest after a stress-filled week or taken it to adjust your sleep-wake cycle during a bout of jet lag. Melatonin, a natural hormone, is similar to indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat aches, pains, and migraines. Some research shows that those with chronic migraines have very low levels of melatonin. One study compared melatonin to amitriptyline (a medicine used in migraine prevention) and to a placebo. The results of that study showed that melatonin was better than a placebo in preventing migraines. It also had fewer side effects than amitriptyline and was just as effective. Melatonin generally works well with your body, but it can cause daytime sleepiness. In rare cases, it can cause abdominal discomfort and even short bouts of depression.

It seems that people with migraines have lower levels of magnesium than the rest of us. Magnesium is naturally found in foods like spinach, nuts, and whole grains. It helps control blood pressure and blood sugar, and your muscles and nerves need it to work properly. Researchers have tested magnesium supplements for treating and preventing migraines. So far, the results are mixed. If you want to try it, you should take about 400 milligrams each day. You have to take it for at least 3 months to know whether it works for you.

Riboflavin plays a key role in metabolism, the process by which our bodies make energy. Research has shown that people with migraines may have a glitch in that process. That glitch could be responsible for the headaches. Riboflavin is considered most likely safe for most people, but it can turn your urine an orange color. To help prevent migraines, you should take about 400 milligrams of riboflavin a day. That's much more than what is in a multivitamin. Don't take more multivitamins to get that much riboflavin. You'd also be taking too much of everything else in that vitamin. And that can cause problems. Taking more than 400 milligrams every day probably won't do you more good. If you're taking antibiotics, specifically tetracycline antibiotics, riboflavin may interfere with them.

Too much magnesium from supplements can bring side effects including: Nausea Cramping Diarrhea Magnesium supplements can also interfere with some antibiotics. Better known as vitamin B2, this may make migraines less frequent and less severe for some people. It's found naturally in foods like: Meat Eggs Milk Green veggies Nuts Enriched flour And like many of the other B vitamins, it's also found in daily vitamin pills. Riboflavin plays a key role in metabolism, the process by which our bodies make energy. Research has shown that people with migraines may have a glitch in that process. That glitch could be responsible for the headaches. Riboflavin is considered most likely safe for most people, but it can turn your urine an orange color. To help prevent migraines, you should take about 400 milligrams of riboflavin a day. That's much more than what is in a multivitamin. Don't take more multivitamins to get that much riboflavin. You'd also be taking too much of everything else in that vitamin. And that can cause problems. Taking more than 400 milligrams every day probably won't do you more good. If you're taking antibiotics, specifically tetracycline antibiotics, riboflavin may interfere with them. This plant, which looks like a daisy, has a long history in treating -- you guessed it -- fevers, as well as aches and pains due to inflammation. Research shows that feverfew may treat and prevent migraines. But most results have been mixed. None of the studies showed that feverfew caused any serious side effects. If you want to try it, start at a low dose of about 50 milligrams a day. It may take a few months to see any results. Don't take feverfew if you take an anticoagulant drug. Like riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, sometimes called co Q10, is a part of metabolism. Foods like liver, whole grains, and oily fish like salmon are the primary food sources for this vitamin. Some studies do show it may help prevent migraines. In one small study, people with migraines were given coenzyme Q10 each day. More than 60% of them had a 50% drop in the number of days they had a migraine. Co Q10 doesn't have many major side effects, though you could get an upset stomach or nausea. Doses higher than 300 milligrams daily may affect your liver. And if you take the anticoagulant warfarin, co Q10 may make it less effective. You may have popped some melatonin to get a good night's rest after a stress-filled week or taken it to adjust your sleep-wake cycle during a bout of jet lag. Melatonin, a natural hormone, is similar to indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat aches, pains, and migraines. Some research shows that those with chronic migraines have very low levels of melatonin. One study compared melatonin to amitriptyline (a medicine used in migraine prevention) and to a placebo. The results of that study showed that melatonin was better than a placebo in preventing migraines. It also had fewer side effects than amitriptyline and was just as effective. Melatonin generally works well with your body, but it can cause daytime sleepiness. In rare cases, it can cause abdominal discomfort and even short bouts of depression. If you take an anticoagulant, an immunosuppressant, diabetes medications, or birth control pills, talk to your doctor since it can interact with these drugs.", "question": "How can melatonin help with migraines?", "answer": ["Melatonin, a natural hormone, is similar to indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat aches, pains, and migraines.

It's likely you've seen terms like âpersonalized medicine,â âprecision medicine,â or âtargeted drugs.â What are these things? More importantly, can they help you? Personalized medicine -- also called precision medicine or pharmacogenetics -- is a new way to fight cancer. It uses information about you and your tumor to figure out what's driving the disease and create a plan just for you. For years, cancer treatment was a cookie-cutter process. You'd have surgery to remove a tumor, then chemotherapy or radiation to kill cancer cells. But blasting cancers with chemotherapy or radiation kills healthy cells as well, which can lead to a host of nasty side effects. Now, researchers can examine your cancer cells and learn the order of the genes in their DNA. While most cells in your body have identical genes, the ones in cancer cells have mutations, or changes. This is what allows them to grow into tumors. What's more, your cancer may have different genetic changes than someone else's. Scientists also now know that genetically, one person's breast cancer may be more similar to another person's stomach tumor than to other breast cancers. This makes the need for personalized medicine even greater. The FDA has approved more than a dozen drugs that target one of these mutations. They include imatinib ( Gleevec), a drug used on chronic myelogenous leukemia, and the breast cancer drug trastuzumab ( Herceptin). Tumor genetics can also tell doctors which drugs won't work. For example, if your colon cancer has a genetic mutation called KRAS, doctors won't give you two common colon cancer drugs because they know they won't work. Many clinical centers do something called tumor profiling. Your doctor takes a look at your tumor's genes. If he thinks your cancer may have specific mutations, he might start you on a specific drug that is tailored for the genetic mutation found in your cancer cells. For instance, if you have breast cancer, a genetic test would tell him if Herceptin might work for you. Profiling can also help if other treatment options, like chemotherapy, haven't worked for you. A genetic mutation might point your medical team toward an unexpected drug, like one originally designed for another type of cancer. The personalized approach works better to shrink tumors -- and save lives -- than traditional treatment. But it isn't always a cure. Tumors can contain cells with different gene mutations, so a targeted therapy designed to pick off cells with one mutation may work on only part of a tumor. The cells that remain may keep growing. Talk to your doctor to find out if this approach could work for you. Standard trials to test cancer treatments use people whose tumors are similar in size or location. They might choose only people with stage IV lung cancer, for instance.

They can last anywhere from a few weeks to years. You may hear a doctor or nurse call them âvenous leg ulcers.â They can sometimes lead to more serious problems if you don't have them treated. But there are steps you can take to prevent them from happening. Venous ulcers happen when there's a break in the skin on your leg, usually around the ankle. The veins in the leg, which should send blood back to the heart, might not be doing their job all that well. That's often because the valves that stop the flow of blood back into the veins aren't working like they should. This backflow of blood means increased pressure in the end of the limb. When that happens, it can weaken the skin and make it harder for a cut or scrape to heal. They often occur over bony areas, such as your ankle. About 1% of Americans have venous skin ulcers. They're more common in older people, particularly women. You also may have a chance of getting one if you: Have previous leg injuries Have varicose veins Smoke Are obese Have had other circulation problems such as blood clots or phlebitis, a painful swelling of the veins A venous ulcer often feels itchy or burns, and the leg around it may be swollen. Other signs may include: A rash or dry skin Brownish discoloration A foul-smelling fluid oozing from the sore An ulcer can also become infected. If that happens, you might notice: A redness or swelling of the surrounding skin Worsening pain A fever Pus If you have a wound that isn't healing or you think is infected, you should see your doctor. Usually, all it takes is a quick examination of the sore and the skin around it to figure out whether you have a venous skin ulcer. Your doctor will ask you if you have a history of ongoing (or âchronicâ) conditions, such as diabetes or hardening of the arteries. In some cases, however, your doctor might order other tests, such as an X-ray or a CT scan, to check out your veins and the area around the ulcer in more detail. Sometimes, an ulcer can lead to other problems, including serious skin and bone infections. And in rare cases, it can give rise to skin cancer. The most common treatment is a compression bandage or stocking. The pressure should improve the blood circulation in your leg, boosting your body's ability to heal the sore. You'll probably be told to raise your leg for set lengths of time as well. This also helps circulation. Doctors typically recommend a half-hour at a time, 3 or 4 times a day. If your ulcer is infected by bacteria, you'll probably be given antibiotics to kill the infection. You might also be given a moist dressing to put over the ulcer to help it heal more quickly. In some cases, your doctor might recommend surgery to improve the circulation in your legs. This can help your ulcer heal and could prevent similar problems later. Most ulcers heal after 3 or 4 months of treatment. However, some can take longer, and some may never clear up.

They can last anywhere from a few weeks to years. You may hear a doctor or nurse call them âvenous leg ulcers.â They can sometimes lead to more serious problems if you don't have them treated. But there are steps you can take to prevent them from happening. Venous ulcers happen when there's a break in the skin on your leg, usually around the ankle. The veins in the leg, which should send blood back to the heart, might not be doing their job all that well. That's often because the valves that stop the flow of blood back into the veins aren't working like they should. This backflow of blood means increased pressure in the end of the limb. When that happens, it can weaken the skin and make it harder for a cut or scrape to heal. They often occur over bony areas, such as your ankle. About 1% of Americans have venous skin ulcers. They're more common in older people, particularly women. You also may have a chance of getting one if you: Have previous leg injuries Have varicose veins Smoke Are obese Have had other circulation problems such as blood clots or phlebitis, a painful swelling of the veins A venous ulcer often feels itchy or burns, and the leg around it may be swollen. Other signs may include: A rash or dry skin Brownish discoloration A foul-smelling fluid oozing from the sore An ulcer can also become infected. If that happens, you might notice: A redness or swelling of the surrounding skin Worsening pain A fever Pus If you have a wound that isn't healing or you think is infected, you should see your doctor. Usually, all it takes is a quick examination of the sore and the skin around it to figure out whether you have a venous skin ulcer. Your doctor will ask you if you have a history of ongoing (or âchronicâ) conditions, such as diabetes or hardening of the arteries. In some cases, however, your doctor might order other tests, such as an X-ray or a CT scan, to check out your veins and the area around the ulcer in more detail. Sometimes, an ulcer can lead to other problems, including serious skin and bone infections. And in rare cases, it can give rise to skin cancer. The most common treatment is a compression bandage or stocking. The pressure should improve the blood circulation in your leg, boosting your body's ability to heal the sore. You'll probably be told to raise your leg for set lengths of time as well. This also helps circulation. Doctors typically recommend a half-hour at a time, 3 or 4 times a day. If your ulcer is infected by bacteria, you'll probably be given antibiotics to kill the infection. You might also be given a moist dressing to put over the ulcer to help it heal more quickly. In some cases, your doctor might recommend surgery to improve the circulation in your legs. This can help your ulcer heal and could prevent similar problems later. Most ulcers heal after 3 or 4 months of treatment. However, some can take longer, and some may never clear up.

First, diabetes can reduce blood flow to your feet, depriving your feet of oxygen and nutrients. This makes it more difficult for blisters, sores, and cuts to heal. And second, the diabetic nerve damage called peripheral neuropathy can cause numbness in your feet. When you can't feel cuts and blisters, you're more likely to get sores and infections. If you don't notice or treat the sores, they can become deeply infected, and lead to amputation. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can also cause sharp pain in your feet. You may become excruciatingly sensitive to the lightest touch, like the sheets on your bed. Fortunately, a little TLC goes a long way in preventing foot problems from diabetes. Look over both feet carefully every day, and be sure you check between all of your toes. Blisters and infections can start between your toes, and with diabetic neuropathy, you may not feel them until they've become irritated or infected. If a physical challenge keeps you from checking your own feet, ask a family member to help. Wash both of your feet briefly each day with warm -- not hot -- water. You may not be able to feel heat with your feet, so test the water with your hands first. Avoid soaking too long in water, since waterlogged sores have a harder time healing. Dry your feet right away, and remember to dry gently between all of your toes. It's an investment worth making. Even the slightest rubbing or misfit shoe can cause a blister that turns into a sore that becomes infected and never heals. Buy better-fitting shoes, or try different socks, even at the most minor signs of redness or irritation, since you may not be able to feel when it's getting worse. Before buying or putting on the shoes check your shoes for rough seams, sharp edges or other objects that could hurt your feet. And break your shoes in gradually. Always wear shoes or slippers. Always wear socks with your shoes, since leather, plastics, and manmade shoe materials can irritate your skin and quickly bring on blisters. While you might prefer the look of hose, nylon knee-highs, or thin socks, you may find that these don't give your toes or heels enough protection. Wear thicker socks to pad your feet and cushion any calluses or sore spots. Nerve damage can be unpredictable. Tell your doctor about any changes in sensation in your toes, feet, or legs. Speak up if you notice pain, tingling, a pins-and-needles feeling, numbness, or any other unusual signs -- even if it seems trivial to you. There's nothing small-potatoes about a potential foot amputation. Your skin may be dry and cracked because of high glucose levels, and cracked skin means it's easier for bacteria to get under your skin and harder for infections to heal. Use a small amount of skin lotion daily, but be sure your feet feel dry, not damp or sticky, afterward. Try not to get the lotion in between your toes. Keep your toenails trimmed and filed smooth to avoid ingrown toenails. You may find it easier to trim your nails after using lotion, when your cuticles are softer. Use a pumice stone after showering or bathing to softly file corns or calluses. Swimming, cycling, yoga, and tai chi are increasingly popular ways to exercise -- with minimal impact on your feet. Talk with your doctor before starting an exercise program. If your big toe slants sharply in toward your other toes, with a big bump on the knuckle of your big toe, you've got a classic bunion. Corns are spots of thick, rough skin, where the tissue builds up on toes constantly barraged by too much rubbing or pressure. A buckled-under toe, called a hammertoe, can result from muscle weakness caused by diabetic nerve damage. All of these make it hard to fit shoes comfortably. A good podiatrist can help you fix these problems and take better care of your feet. A podiatrist can also fit you with shoe inserts called orthotics to support your feet if your have diabetic nerve pain or the muscles have become weak from nerve damage. If pain or weakness is so severe that it's too painful or even impossible to walk, a foot brace or orthopedic shoes might help. A podiatrist is your best source for these devices. The best prevention for nerve pain, ultimately, is to manage your diabetes well. In fact, a 2006 study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases showed that strict blood glucose control with intensive insulin therapy lowered the chances in people with type I (insulin requiring) diabetes of having symptoms of peripheral neuropathy -- tingling, burning, and pain -- by 64%. These results have also been shown to hold true in type II diabetes, too. The two most important determinants of whether you get diabetic neuropathy are how many years you have had diabetes and how well you control your blood sugar. Other factors, including controlling blood pressure and blood fats (cholesterol and triglycerides) and not smoking are also important to prevent diabetic neuropathy. Controlling your blood glucose also helps reduce the symptoms of diabetic nerve pain. So the good news is that controlling your glucose levels with diet, exercise, and if needed, medications can not only help prevent diabetic peripheral neuropathy, but they can also help ease its effects. Your feet are your source of independence, or at least its foundation. Give your feet a little tenderness, a little loving care, each day.

Some with rheumatoid arthritis find that menopause can affect their RA. Researchers aren't sure why, but hormones seem to play a role in RA. Nearly three times as many women get the disease as men. Many women who have it see their symptoms improve while they're pregnant. This may be because their estrogen levels go up during pregnancy. Estrogen levels drop around the time of menopause. When that happens, RA symptoms may worsen. Some women first get symptoms around the time they start menopause. You might think that taking estrogen would reduce RA symptoms along with the symptoms of menopause, but that doesn't seem to be the case. And because hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) is linked with heart disease -- another increased risk for women with rheumatoid arthritis - doctors rarely recommend it for treating menopause symptoms in women with RA. Rheumatoid arthritis makes osteoporosis more likely. So does menopause. Those are good reasons for women with RA to get their bone density levels checked and make sure they get enough calcium and vitamin D. Your rheumatologist can calculate your odds of getting a bone fracture over the next 10 years by giving you a DEXA scan to measure your bone density. They'll find the best treatment or prevention plan for you. Your doctor may recommend that you take prescription drugs to keep up your bone density and strength. RA can sometimes make it tough to have a good sex life. On top of that, menopause can increase vaginal dryness, making sex painful. Many women with RA also have SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, an immune system condition that attacks moisture-producing glands in the body. It can cause vaginal dryness and make sex painful. Talk to your doctor about lubricants that may help. If you're concerned about joint pain during sex, these ideas can help: Some positions -- like lying side by side with your partner -- can take the stress off your hips or other affected joints. You can also plan intimacy for the times of day when you usually feel less pain. Menopause and pain can affect your desire. Your partner may also be afraid that they'll cause you pain. It can help if both of you talk together with a doctor or counselor. Menopause can make the fatigue that comes with RA worse.

Many women who have it see their symptoms improve while they're pregnant. This may be because their estrogen levels go up during pregnancy. Estrogen levels drop around the time of menopause. When that happens, RA symptoms may worsen. Some women first get symptoms around the time they start menopause. You might think that taking estrogen would reduce RA symptoms along with the symptoms of menopause, but that doesn't seem to be the case. And because hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) is linked with heart disease -- another increased risk for women with rheumatoid arthritis - doctors rarely recommend it for treating menopause symptoms in women with RA. Rheumatoid arthritis makes osteoporosis more likely. So does menopause.

RA can sometimes make it tough to have a good sex life. On top of that, menopause can increase vaginal dryness, making sex painful.

But there are steps you can take to maintain good eye health and prevent vision loss. Cataracts, when the eye's lens clouds up, are a common cause of vision loss and a normal part of the aging process. Glaucoma, a disease that damages your optic nerve, is a leading cause of blindness for people over 60. They're not specific to diabetes, but they can show up earlier if you have it. It all depends on how well you control your blood sugar. And they're just two more reasons you need to work closely with your doctor to keep the disease under control. If you already have one of these conditions, talk to your eye doctor about treatment. Early action can prevent blindness from glaucoma. Surgery can remove cataracts. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common type of diabetic eye disease. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to have some degree of diabetic retinopathy. How bad it will be depends on how well you control your blood sugar. High blood sugar levels damage blood vessels throughout your body, including the ones in your retina. This thin layer of light-sensitive tissue lines the back of the eye and sends light to your brain. That's what allows you to see. There are 2 types: 1. Background or non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR): This is the earliest stage. Damaged blood vessels begin to leak into the retina. NPDR can cause changes in the eye including: Macular edema: Blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula and it swells. Located in the center of your retina, it's what gives you your pinpoint vision. This won't lead to blindness, but it can cause blurred vision. It can get better once you get your blood sugar and blood pressure under control. If it doesn't improve, lasers or medications injected directly into your eye may help. Macular ischemia: This loss of blood flow results when small blood vessels in your retina close up. Your vision blurs because the macula no longer gets enough blood to work like it should. 2. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR): This advanced stage mainly happens when vessels in the retina close up and deprive it of blood. In an attempt to supply blood to the affected area, the retina creates new but abnormal and weak vessels. They can grow into the wrong place and break easily. PDR can cause more severe vision loss than NPDR. You may not notice any changes in the early stages. That's why you need regular eye exams. Even if you don't have any signs of or risk factors for eye disease, get a screening test at age 40. If you have diabetes, get a dilated exam as soon as you're diagnosed. Your doctor will put drops in your eye to widen the pupil. That lets him get a better look at your retina and optic nerve. Adults with type 2 diabetes should get a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Your eye doctor will let you know if you need to come in more often. Let him know if you notice sudden vision changes. Blurry vision can result from blood sugar that's too high or too low.", "question": "What is the most common type of diabetic eye disease?", "answer": ["Diabetic retinopathy is the most common type of diabetic eye disease.

S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana in some form, and more are considering bills to do the same. Yet while many people are using marijuana, the FDA has only approved it for treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox- Gastaut syndrome. Why hasn't more research been done? One reason is that the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, and likely to be abused and lacking in medical value. Because of that, researchers need a special license to study it, says Marcel Bonn- Miller, Ph D, a substance abuse specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. That may not change anytime soon. The DEA considered reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II drug like Ritalin or oxycodone, but decided ito keep it as a Schedule I drug. The agency did, however, agree to support additional research on marijuana and make the process easier for researchers.\" Research is critically needed, because we have to be able to advise patients and doctors on the safe and effective use of cannabis,\" Bonn- Miller says. He shared some background on medical marijuana's uses and potential side effects. Medical marijuana uses the marijuana plant or chemicals in it to treat diseases or conditions. It's basically the same product as recreational marijuana, but it's taken for medical purposes. The marijuana plant contains more than 100 different chemicals called cannabinoids. Each one has a different effect on the body. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) and cannabidiol ( CBD) are the main chemicals used in medicine. THC also produces the \"high\" people feel when they smoke marijuana or eat foods containing it. var ia Module Data = ia Module Data || []; ia Module Data.push({ type: ' Video', id: 'ia-video-1', position: 'left', mode: 'interactive', video: { chronicle ID: '091e9c5e81408112', title: ' Medical Marijuana: What Does It Treat?

Cannabinoids -- the active chemicals in medical marijuana -- are similar to chemicals the body makes that are involved in appetite, memory, movement, and pain. Research suggests cannabinoids might: Reduce anxiety Reduce inflammation and relieve pain Control nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy Kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth Relax tight muscles in people with MS Stimulate appetite and improve weight gain in people with cancer and AIDS Medical marijuana received a lot of attention a few years ago when parents said that a special form of the drug helped control seizures in their children. The FDA recently approved Epidiolex, which is made from CBD, as a therapy for people with very severe or hard-to-treat seizures. In studies, some people had a dramatic drop in seizures after taking this drug. Medical marijuana is legal in 33 states and the District of Columbia: Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Hawaii Illinois Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Missouri Montana Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island Utah Vermont Washington West Virginia States that allow restricted use only include: Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. To get medical marijuana, you need a written recommendation from a licensed doctor in states where that is legal. ( Not every doctor is willing to recommend medical marijuana for their patients.) You must have a condition that qualifies for medical marijuana use. Each state has its own list of qualifying conditions. Your state may also require you to get a medical marijuana ID card. Once you have that card, you can buy medical marijuana at a store called a dispensary. To take medical marijuana, you can: Smoke it Inhale it through a device called a vaporizer that turns it into a mist Eat it -- for example, in a brownie or lollipop Apply it to your skin in a lotion, spray, oil, or cream Place a few drops of a liquid under your tongue How you take it is up to you. Each method works differently in your body. \" If you smoke or vaporize cannabis, you feel the effects very quickly,\" Bonn- Miller says. \" If you eat it, it takes significantly longer. It can take 1 to 2 hours to experience the effects from edible products.\" The FDA has approved two man-made cannabinoid medicines -- dronabinol ( Marinol, Syndros) and nabilone ( Cesamet) -- to treat nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy. The cannabidiol Epidiolex was approved in 2018 for treating seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox- Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Side effects that have been reported include: Bloodshot eyes Depression Dizziness Fast heartbeat Hallucinations Low blood pressure The drug can also affect judgment and coordination, which could lead to accidents and injuries. When used during the teenage years when the brain is still developing, marijuana might affect IQ and mental function. var ia Module Data = ia Module Data || []; ia Module Data.push({ type: ' Slideshow', id: 'ia-slideshow-2', position: 'left', title: ' Slideshow: Medical Marijuana', description: ' See the types of medical marijuana and find out what conditions it can treat.

The effects of inhaled marijuana on lung health aren't clear, but there's some evidence it might increase the risk for bronchitis and other lung problems. The National Institute on Drug Abuse says marijuana can be addictive and is considered a âgateway drugâ to using other drugs. \" The higher the level of THC and the more often you use, the more likely you are to become dependent,\" Bonn- Miller says. \" You have difficulty stopping if you need to stop. You have cravings during periods when you're not using. And you need more and more of it to have the same effect.\" Another issue is that the FDA doesn't oversee medical marijuana like it does prescription drugs. Although states monitor and regulate sales, they often don't have the resources to do so. That means the strength of and ingredients in medical marijuana can differ quite a bit depending on where you buy it. \" We did a study last year in which we purchased labeled edible products, like brownies and lollipops, in California and Washington. Then we sent them to the lab,\" Bonn- Miller says. \" Few of the products contained anywhere near what they said they did.

Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, and likely to be abused and lacking in medical value. Because of that, researchers need a special license to study it, says Marcel Bonn- Miller, Ph D, a substance abuse specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.

He shared some background on medical marijuana's uses and potential side effects. Medical marijuana uses the marijuana plant or chemicals in it to treat diseases or conditions. It's basically the same product as recreational marijuana, but it's taken for medical purposes. The marijuana plant contains more than 100 different chemicals called cannabinoids. Each one has a different effect on the body. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) and cannabidiol ( CBD) are the main chemicals used in medicine. THC also produces the \"high\" people feel when they smoke marijuana or eat foods containing it. var ia Module Data = ia Module Data || []; ia Module Data.push({ type: ' Video', id: 'ia-video-1', position: 'left', mode: 'interactive', video: { chronicle ID: '091e9c5e81408112', title: ' Medical Marijuana: What Does It Treat?

Medical marijuana is legal in 33 states and the District of Columbia: Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Hawaii Illinois Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Missouri Montana Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island Utah Vermont Washington West Virginia States that allow restricted use only include: Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. To get medical marijuana, you need a written recommendation from a licensed doctor in states where that is legal. ( Not every doctor is willing to recommend medical marijuana for their patients.) You must have a condition that qualifies for medical marijuana use. Each state has its own list of qualifying conditions. Your state may also require you to get a medical marijuana ID card. Once you have that card, you can buy medical marijuana at a store called a dispensary. To take medical marijuana, you can: Smoke it Inhale it through a device called a vaporizer that turns it into a mist Eat it -- for example, in a brownie or lollipop Apply it to your skin in a lotion, spray, oil, or cream Place a few drops of a liquid under your tongue How you take it is up to you. Each method works differently in your body. \" If you smoke or vaporize cannabis, you feel the effects very quickly,\" Bonn- Miller says. \" If you eat it, it takes significantly longer. It can take 1 to 2 hours to experience the effects from edible products.\" The FDA has approved two man-made cannabinoid medicines -- dronabinol ( Marinol, Syndros) and nabilone ( Cesamet) -- to treat nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy. The cannabidiol Epidiolex was approved in 2018 for treating seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox- Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Side effects that have been reported include: Bloodshot eyes Depression Dizziness Fast heartbeat Hallucinations Low blood pressure The drug can also affect judgment and coordination, which could lead to accidents and injuries. When used during the teenage years when the brain is still developing, marijuana might affect IQ and mental function. var ia Module Data = ia Module Data || []; ia Module Data.push({ type: ' Slideshow', id: 'ia-slideshow-2', position: 'left', title: ' Slideshow: Medical Marijuana', description: ' See the types of medical marijuana and find out what conditions it can treat.

Yet while many people are using marijuana, the FDA has only approved it for treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox- Gastaut syndrome. Why hasn't more research been done? One reason is that the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, and likely to be abused and lacking in medical value. Because of that, researchers need a special license to study it, says Marcel Bonn- Miller, Ph D, a substance abuse specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. That may not change anytime soon. The DEA considered reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II drug like Ritalin or oxycodone, but decided ito keep it as a Schedule I drug.

He shared some background on medical marijuana's uses and potential side effects. Medical marijuana uses the marijuana plant or chemicals in it to treat diseases or conditions. It's basically the same product as recreational marijuana, but it's taken for medical purposes. The marijuana plant contains more than 100 different chemicals called cannabinoids.

Cannabinoids -- the active chemicals in medical marijuana -- are similar to chemicals the body makes that are involved in appetite, memory, movement, and pain. Research suggests cannabinoids might: Reduce anxiety Reduce inflammation and relieve pain Control nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy Kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth Relax tight muscles in people with MS Stimulate appetite and improve weight gain in people with cancer and AIDS Medical marijuana received a lot of attention a few years ago when parents said that a special form of the drug helped control seizures in their children.

Hundreds of foods and plant-based fiber products are available to relieve constipation -- naturally. Dietary fiber refers to the edible parts of plants or carbohydrates that cannot be digested. Fiber is in all plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes. You can also find a form of fiber called chitin in the shells of crustaceans such as crab, lobster, and shrimp. No, some fibers are soluble in water and others are insoluble. Soluble fiber slows digestion and helps you absorb nutrients from food. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool, helping the stool pass more quickly through the intestines. Most plant foods contain some of each kind of fiber. Foods containing high levels of soluble fiber include dried beans, oats, oat bran, rice bran, barley, citrus fruits, apples, strawberries, peas, and potatoes. Foods high in insoluble fiber include wheat bran, whole grains, cereals, seeds, and the skins of many fruits and vegetables. Go for whole-grain breads, cereals, and pastas. Cereal fibers generally have cell walls that resist digestion and retain water within the cellular structures. Wheat bran can be highly effective as a natural laxative. Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes such as beans and lentils. The fiber found in citrus fruits and legumes stimulate the growth of colonic flora, which increases the stool weight and the amount of bacteria in the stool. Encouraging the growth of certain bacteria in the colon may help promote a healthy intestine. The average American gets about 15 grams of fiber daily, much less than we need, according to the American Dietetic Association. Women younger than 51 should aim for 25 grams of fiber daily. Men younger than 51 should aim for 38 grams of fiber daily. Women 51 and older should get 21 grams of fiber daily. Men 51 and older should get 30 grams daily. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends eating at least nine servings (2 cups) of fiber-filled fruits and vegetables each day, including apples, oranges, broccoli, berries, pears, peas, figs, carrots, and beans.

Neither is any other part of your body. Is the paralysis all in your head? Actually, it might be. You could have what's called conversion disorder. It's a neurological condition that causes physical symptoms -- like a paralyzed arm -- even though doctors can't find any injury or other physical condition to explain them. In other words, your body converted your emotional and psychological stress from falling off your bike into the physical response of your paralyzed arm. It might seem strange, but your symptoms are real, and you can't control them. While the specific cause of conversion disorder is still being studied, researchers think it develops as a way for your brain to deal with emotional strife. It's almost always triggered by stressful situations and other mental disorders. And the symptoms usually develop suddenly. Women are more likely to have it than men. It also happens more often to people with a history of emotional trauma, and in those who have a hard time talking about their feelings. Sometimes, physical symptoms might help resolve some sort of internal conflict. For example, if you're struggling with the desire to hurt someone, conversion disorder may cause you to develop paralysis, making it impossible to act on that desire. Conversion disorder symptoms most commonly look like issues involving your nervous system (brain, spinal cord, or other nerves). These include: Uncontrollable movements Tunnel vision or blindness Loss of smell or speech Numbness or paralysis There's no test to diagnose conversion disorder. And because the cause is unknown, it's usually diagnosed by the process of elimination. When tests rule out other physical, mental, or neurological causes, your doctor may ask you if you've experienced any recent traumatic events. For your doctor to diagnose you with conversion disorder, your symptoms must meet the standards set by the American Psychiatric Association: They affect your movement or senses, and you can't control them. They can be related to a stressful event, but don't have to be. You're not faking them. They can't be explained by any other condition, medication, or behavior. They cause you stress in social and work settings. They aren't caused by another mental health problem. Simply knowing that you're not suffering from a serious physical condition can be enough to for the symptoms to stop. But if they persist, getting help from your doctor early may help prevent long-term effects. There is no specific medication to treat conversion disorder. Psychotherapy treatments are most often used, including: Occupational or physical therapy Counseling Hypnosis Antidepressants or antipsychotic drugs Symptoms can last from a few days to several weeks. Sometimes they just go away as suddenly as they came on. Most of the time they're not life-threatening, but they can still have lasting side effects if you don't seek treatment. The best way to prevent conversion disorder is to try to find effective ways to manage life's unavoidable stresses. Physical exercise and stress-relieving activities like yoga and meditation may help.

Just because a child seems depressed or sad does not necessarily mean they have depression. But if these symptoms become persistent, disruptive and interfere with social activities, interests, schoolwork and family life, it may indicate that he or she is suffering from the medical condition depression. The symptoms of depression in children vary. Early medical studies focused on \"masked\" depression, where a child's depressed mood was evidenced by acting out or angry behavior. While this does occur, particularly in younger children, many children display sadness or low mood similar to adults who are depressed. The primary symptoms of depression revolve around sadness, a feeling of hopelessness, and mood changes and may include: Irritability or anger Continuous feelings of sadness or hopelessness Social withdrawal Increased sensitivity to rejection Changes in appetite -- either increased or decreased Changes in sleep -- sleeplessness or excessive sleep Vocal outbursts or crying Difficulty concentrating Fatigue and low energy Physical complaints (such as stomachaches, headaches) that do not respond to treatment Reduced ability to function during events and activities at home or with friends, in school, extracurricular activities, and in other hobbies or interests Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Impaired thinking or concentration Thoughts of death or suicide Not all children have all of these symptoms. In fact, most will display different symptoms at different times and in different settings. Although some children may continue to function reasonably well, most kids with significant depression will suffer a noticeable change in social activities, loss of interest in school and poor academic performance, or a change in appearance. Children may also begin using drugs or alcohol, especially if they are over age 12. Although relatively rare in youths under age 12, young children do attempt suicide -- and may do so impulsively when they are upset or angry. Suicide is a serious problem within the teenage population. Adolescent suicide is a leading cause of death among youth and young adults in the U. S. It is estimated that 500,000 teens attempt suicide every year with 5,000 completing the act. These are epidemic proportions. Children with a family history of violence, alcohol abuse, or physical or sexual abuse are at greater risk for suicide, as are those with depressive symptoms. Parents should be particularly vigilant for signs that may indicate that their child is at risk for suicide. Warning signs of suicidal behavior in children include: Many depressive symptoms (changes in eating, sleeping, activities, or restlessness/agitation) Social isolation Talk of suicide, hopelessness, or helplessness Increased acting-out of undesirable behaviors (sexual/behavioral) Increased risk-taking behaviors Frequent accidents Substance abuse Focus on morbid and negative themes Talk about death and dying Increased crying or reduced emotional expression Giving away possessions As in adults, depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability, and biochemical disturbance. Children with a family history of depression are at greater risk of experiencing depression themselves. Children who have parents that suffer from depression tend to develop their first episode of depression earlier than children whose parents do not. Children from chaotic or conflicted families, or children and teens who abuse substances like alcohol and drugs, are also at greater risk of depression. If symptoms of depression in your child have lasted for at least two weeks, you should schedule a visit with his or her health care provider to make sure there are no physical reasons for the symptoms and to ensure that your child receives proper treatment. If your child's health care provider suspects depression, he or she will recommend you take your child to see a mental health care professional, typically either a psychiatrist or a psychologist. There are no specific tests -- medical or psychological -- that can clearly show depression, but clinical interviews conducted by trained and experienced mental health professionals along with tools such as questionnaires (for both the child and parents) combined with personal information can be very useful. Information from teachers, friends and classmates can be useful for showing that these symptoms are consistent during your child's various activities and are a marked change from previous behavior. Treatment options for children with depression are similar to those for adults, including psychotherapy (counseling) and medicine. The role that family and the child's environment play in the treatment process is different from that of adults. Your child's health care provider may suggest psychotherapy first, and consider antidepressant medicine as an additional option if symptoms are especially severe or if there is not significant improvement from psychotherapy alone. Currently, there are no good studies documenting the effectiveness of medicine over psychotherapy in children. However, studies do show that the antidepressant Fluoxetine ( Prozac) is effective in treating depression in children and teens. The drug is officially recognized by the FDA for treatment of children ages 8 to18 with depression. Other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) are used, as well. Most medications used to treat depression in children have a black box warning about increasing suicidal thoughts. It is important to start and monitor these medications under the care of a trained professional. Studies have found that first-time depression in children is occurring at younger ages than previously. As in adults, it may occur again later in life. Depression often occurs at the same time as other physical illnesses. And because studies have shown that depression may precede more serious mental illness later in life, diagnosis, early treatment and close monitoring are crucial. As a parent, it is sometimes easier to deny that your child has depression. You may put off seeking the help of a mental health care professional because of the social stigmas associated with mental illness. It is very important for you -- as the parent -- to understand depression and realize the importance of treatment so that your child may continue to grow physically and emotionally in a healthy way. It is also important to seek education about the future effects depression may have on your child throughout adolescence and adulthood. If you are a parent of a teenager, you are aware of the challenges involved, especially when it comes to communicating. Here are some tips to make communicating with your teenager easier: When disciplining your child, replace shame and punishment with positive reinforcement for good behavior. Shame and punishment can make an adolescent feel worthless and inadequate. Allow your teenager to make mistakes. Overprotection or making decisions for teens can be perceived as a lack of faith in their abilities. This can make them feel less confident. Give your teen breathing room. Don't expect them to do exactly as you say all of the time. Do not force your child down a path you wanted to follow. Avoid trying to relive your youth through your child's activities and experiences. If you suspect that your child or teenager is depressed, take the time to listen to his or her concerns. Even if you don't think the problem is of real concern, remember that it may feel very real to them. It is important to keep the lines of communication open, even if your child seems to want to withdraw. Try to avoid telling your child what to do. Instead, listen closely and you may discover more about the issues causing the problems. If you feel overwhelmed or unable to reach your child, or if you continue to be concerned, seek help from a qualified health care professional.", "question": "What are symptoms of depression in children?", "answer": ["The primary symptoms of depression revolve around sadness, a feeling of hopelessness, and mood changes and may include: Irritability or anger Continuous feelings of sadness or hopelessness Social withdrawal Increased sensitivity to rejection Changes in appetite -- either increased or decreased Changes in sleep -- sleeplessness or excessive sleep Vocal outbursts or crying Difficulty concentrating Fatigue and low energy Physical complaints (such as stomachaches, headaches) that do not respond to treatment Reduced ability to function during events and activities at home or with friends, in school, extracurricular activities, and in other hobbies or interests Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Impaired thinking or concentration Thoughts of death or suicide Not all children have all of these symptoms."]}

Warning signs of suicidal behavior in children include: Many depressive symptoms (changes in eating, sleeping, activities, or restlessness/agitation) Social isolation Talk of suicide, hopelessness, or helplessness Increased acting-out of undesirable behaviors (sexual/behavioral) Increased risk-taking behaviors Frequent accidents Substance abuse Focus on morbid and negative themes Talk about death and dying Increased crying or reduced emotional expression Giving away possessions As in adults, depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability, and biochemical disturbance. Children with a family history of depression are at greater risk of experiencing depression themselves. Children who have parents that suffer from depression tend to develop their first episode of depression earlier than children whose parents do not. Children from chaotic or conflicted families, or children and teens who abuse substances like alcohol and drugs, are also at greater risk of depression. If symptoms of depression in your child have lasted for at least two weeks, you should schedule a visit with his or her health care provider to make sure there are no physical reasons for the symptoms and to ensure that your child receives proper treatment. If your child's health care provider suspects depression, he or she will recommend you take your child to see a mental health care professional, typically either a psychiatrist or a psychologist. There are no specific tests -- medical or psychological -- that can clearly show depression, but clinical interviews conducted by trained and experienced mental health professionals along with tools such as questionnaires (for both the child and parents) combined with personal information can be very useful. Information from teachers, friends and classmates can be useful for showing that these symptoms are consistent during your child's various activities and are a marked change from previous behavior. Treatment options for children with depression are similar to those for adults, including psychotherapy (counseling) and medicine. The role that family and the child's environment play in the treatment process is different from that of adults. Your child's health care provider may suggest psychotherapy first, and consider antidepressant medicine as an additional option if symptoms are especially severe or if there is not significant improvement from psychotherapy alone. Currently, there are no good studies documenting the effectiveness of medicine over psychotherapy in children. However, studies do show that the antidepressant Fluoxetine ( Prozac) is effective in treating depression in children and teens. The drug is officially recognized by the FDA for treatment of children ages 8 to18 with depression. Other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) are used, as well. Most medications used to treat depression in children have a black box warning about increasing suicidal thoughts. It is important to start and monitor these medications under the care of a trained professional. Studies have found that first-time depression in children is occurring at younger ages than previously. As in adults, it may occur again later in life. Depression often occurs at the same time as other physical illnesses. And because studies have shown that depression may precede more serious mental illness later in life, diagnosis, early treatment and close monitoring are crucial. As a parent, it is sometimes easier to deny that your child has depression. You may put off seeking the help of a mental health care professional because of the social stigmas associated with mental illness. It is very important for you -- as the parent -- to understand depression and realize the importance of treatment so that your child may continue to grow physically and emotionally in a healthy way. It is also important to seek education about the future effects depression may have on your child throughout adolescence and adulthood. If you are a parent of a teenager, you are aware of the challenges involved, especially when it comes to communicating. Here are some tips to make communicating with your teenager easier: When disciplining your child, replace shame and punishment with positive reinforcement for good behavior. Shame and punishment can make an adolescent feel worthless and inadequate. Allow your teenager to make mistakes. Overprotection or making decisions for teens can be perceived as a lack of faith in their abilities. This can make them feel less confident. Give your teen breathing room. Don't expect them to do exactly as you say all of the time. Do not force your child down a path you wanted to follow. Avoid trying to relive your youth through your child's activities and experiences. If you suspect that your child or teenager is depressed, take the time to listen to his or her concerns. Even if you don't think the problem is of real concern, remember that it may feel very real to them. It is important to keep the lines of communication open, even if your child seems to want to withdraw. Try to avoid telling your child what to do. Instead, listen closely and you may discover more about the issues causing the problems. If you feel overwhelmed or unable to reach your child, or if you continue to be concerned, seek help from a qualified health care professional.", "question": "Who is at risk for childhood depression?", "answer": ["Children with a family history of depression are at greater risk of experiencing depression themselves.

It can feel good when you help ease some of it. That isn't always easy to do, so talk to a doctor about it first. You can try these ways to help relieve his aches and pains at home: Some people hold back from talking about pain. They may not want to be a burden, or they may feel that it's a sign of weakness to admit it. Encourage them that it's OK to let you know how they really feel, so you can help them take care of it. Or they may have trouble expressing it if they have dementia or have had a stroke. It's important to help treat pain, so your loved one can keep up with daily activities, stay as independent as possible, and feel better mentally and physically. Ask the person you're caring for if he is in pain. Many of the signs are obvious -- crying, moaning, clenched fists, âknittedâ eyebrows. A poor appetite may also be a clue. If the person can't tell you if they're in pain, you may need to have a doctor or therapist do an exam, including a check for bedsores. A warm shower or bath, hot water bottle, or warm cloth can help relax muscles and ease muscle spasms. A heating pad with an automatic off switch is better than a regular heating pad, which can burn skin if left on too long. Be careful with microwavable heating pads, as these can have hot spots that burn. Apply heat to the sore area for 20 to 30 minutes every 2 hours. Don't use heat on open wounds. Cold can numb pain and ease swelling. Try a cool cloth, cold pack, cold compression wrap, or ice massage. To make an ice pack, put crushed ice in a plastic bag and cover it with a towel. Don't put the bag of ice directly on your loved one's skin. Or you can use a bag of frozen peas. Ice as soon as possible after an injury. Do it for 15-20 minutes at a time, 4-8 times per day. Stop icing when the area feels numb. Slow, quiet breathing helps relax the body and mind and ease pain. You can show your loved one how to do this: Lie or sit with one hand on your belly and take a deep, slow breath. Imagine filling a balloon in your belly with air. Then breathe out, as if you're letting all the air out of the balloon. Think of breathing out stressful thoughts and breathing in relaxation. Aim for about six long, deep breaths a minute. If your loved one has lung problems, talk to his doctor about what breathing exercises would be good to try, or if other ways to relax would be better. This can be as simple as a foot, back, or hand rub. With your whole hand, the heel of your hand, or your fingertips, apply gentle pressure in slow, steady, circular movements. Warm oil or lotion may help. Massage in one area for 10 seconds first to see if it feels good. Notice if he prefers a light stroke or a firm one. It shouldn't cause pain. Ask your loved one's doctor what nonprescription pain medicines are OK to use, if needed. Acetaminophen is probably the safest for mild to moderate pain.

They do know it comes back more often in people with weakened immune systems. var ia Module Data = ia Module Data || []; ia Module Data.push({ type: ' Video', id: 'ia-video-2', position: 'left', mode: 'interactive', video: { chronicle ID: '091e9c5e8142a023', title: ' The Basics: Shingles', description: ' If you've had chicken pox, then you can get shingles.

Over time, your chances of a second bout go up. One study found that within 7 years, the odds of getting it again may be almost 5%. That's about the same as the odds of getting shingles the first time. You're more likely to get it again if: You had severe pain from shingles that lasted more than 30 days. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia ( PHN). You are a woman. You were age 50 or older when you had shingles the first time. Your immune system is weak from conditions like leukemia, lymphoma, or HIV, or you take medicines that suppress your immune system. The CDC suggests getting the shingles vaccine Shingrix ( RZV) if you're age 50 or older. It was approved in 2017 and has been found to be more than 90% effective in preventing shingles and the complications caused by the disease. Even if you've already had shingles, the CDC says the vaccine can help prevent a second round of it. Shingrix is preferred over an earlier vaccine, Zostavax. You should also get it if you previously had the Zostavax vaccine. Talk to your doctor about when to get the vaccine. If you've just gotten over shingles, he CDC recommends waiting at least until the shingles rash has disappeared. You should not get the Shingrix vaccine if you: Are pregnant or nursing You are allergic to the vaccine You tested negative for immunity to chickenpox (varicella zoster)- If so, you should ask about the chicken pox (varicella) vaccine Since the older vaccine, Zostavax, is a live virus, You should not get it if you are allergic to the vaccine, have a weakened immune system, or are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant in the next 4 weeks. Shingles is likely to return in a different part of your body. In general, the rash is most common on the torso or face. So if you've had it on the right side of your stomach, it might come back on the left side - or on your face, chest, neck, or back. A blistering rash in the shape of a band is the telltale sign of shingles. If your immune system is weak, the rash may come on several parts of your body. Other symptoms to look out for: Pain, itching, or tingling, which may start a few days before the rash appears Headache Fever Chills Upset stomach See your doctor at the first sign of shingles. Getting treated early can help it go away faster and may help you avoid related problems. For instance, shingles on the face can cause hearing or sight problems, including blindness. If you have a weak immune system and can't get the vaccine, early treatment is your best defense against shingles. Sometimes what seems to be shingles is really herpes simplex. Though it usually appears as \"cold sores\" around the mouth or genitals, this form of herpes can show up elsewhere. A different treatment is used to clear it up. Your doctor can do tests, such as a viral culture, to confirm whether you have shingles and to get you the right treatment. As with a first case of shingles, antiviral medicines can help ease a second case. These include: Acyclovir Valacyclovir Famciclovir To relieve itching, try: Oatmeal baths Wet compresses Calamine lotion If you get PHN pain, your doctor may suggest gabapentin (an anti-seizure medicine) or a rub-on cream or lotion. Antidepressants can also help pain. Steroids are sometimes used to treat shingles. Shingles treatments like antivirals work best when you start them right away. Call your doctor as soon as a rash appears -- or you have any symptom you think may be shingles. If you had it once, you know the symptoms. That can give you a head start on the road to recovery.", "question": "Does shingles come back in the same place?", "answer": ["Shingles is likely to return in a different part of your body.

But if you're diagnosed with cervical cancer, know it's very treatable when your doctor finds it early. It's also one of the most preventable cancers in women because of available screenings and vaccinations. While regular screenings are the most important thing you can do to detect precancerous cells, there are other things you also need to know to spot symptoms early. The most important step to find precancerous cervical cells is getting screened. Tests can pick up changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Pap tests look for abnormal cells in your cervix that are starting to turn into cancer. Your gynecologist will perform a Pap test during your routine pelvic exam. It's quick and painless. You lie on an exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to keep your vagina open. It also lets her see your cervix. Next, she'll use a small brush to swab some cells from your cervix. The cells are sent a lab where they're checked for signs of cancer. Most women ages 21 to 65 need to be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap test every 3 years. You can get an HPV test alone or with your Pap test, known as co-testing, every five years starting after age 30. Human papilloma virus is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the high-risk types of the virus cause almost all cervical cancers. If you test positive for HPV, that doesn't mean you'll get cervical cancer. If you're over age 30, doctors recommend you get both tests every 3-5 years. Most women in the early stages of cervical cancer don't have any symptoms. That's why Pap and HPV screening tests are so important. Symptoms don't usually start until the cancer spreads to other organs and tissues. If you do have symptoms, you might notice: Abnormal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or after menopause) Heavier than normal periods Pain during sex Unusual vaginal discharge that might contain blood These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other diseases or infections cause them, too. See your gynecologist if you notice any of them. If you have an abnormal Pap test and other symptoms of cervical cancer, your gynecologist will want find out more about your medical history and your family's. She'll likely run more tests to find out if you have cancer cells in your cervix, and check your lymph nodes to see if cancer has spread. Some of the tests your gynecologist might use to check for cancer cells include: Colposcopy. During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix. This liquid helps her see any abnormal cells. It might burn a little. Cervical biopsies. Your doctor might also remove a small piece of tissue during your colposcopy to check for cancer. This is known as a colposcopic biopsy. Other types of biopsies include: Endocervical curettage uses a thin instrument called a curette to scrape away cells Loop electro-surgical excision procedure ( LEEP) uses a thin wire heated by an electric current to remove cells Punch biopsy uses a tool called biopsy forceps to remove tissue Cone biopsy is another, more invasive, way for your doctor to take a tissue sample, so it's usually performed in a hospital. It can also treat some early-stage cervical cancers. Your doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix with either a LEEP, scalpel or laser. Cells taken from your cervix from any type of biopsy will be sent to a lab and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. You might have mild cramps and bleeding after these procedures. If your biopsy shows you have cervical cancer, the next step is to see if it has spread, and where. Your doctor might order one or more of these tests: Cystoscopy and proctoscopy. These tests both use a lighted tube to see if the cancer has spread into your bladder and rectum. CT scan. This powerful X-ray can show your doctor if your cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, liver, lungs, or other parts of your body. MRI. Your doctor might use an MRI to get very detailed images of inside your body. An MRI can find cancer that has spread to your pelvis, brain, or spinal cord. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will look to see if cancer has spread to your lungs. Positron emission tomography ( PET). Your doctor might order a PET scan if she thinks your cancer has spread but isn't sure where. It uses a type of radioactive sugar that cancer cells absorb. A special camera can spot the cells that have absorbed the sugar. After all of the tests results are back, your doctor will use them to determine if and how far your cancer has spread, which will show them what stage it is in. Staging classifies the cancer by how much is in your body and where it has spread when it's diagnosed. Knowing the stage can help your medical team plan the right treatment for you. Stages of cervical cancer are: Stage 0. Cancer is only on the surface of the cervix and have not grown into deeper tissues. Stage I. The cancer has grown into the cervix and may be growing into the body of the uterus. It may also have spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread distantly. Stage II. The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and uterus. It may have reached the upper part of the vagina. It may involve local lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage III. The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina or the walls of the pelvis. It may or may not involve the nearby lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage IV. This is the most advanced stage. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, like the bladder, rectum, lungs, liver, or distant lymph nodes.

During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix. This liquid helps her see any abnormal cells. It might burn a little. Cervical biopsies. Your doctor might also remove a small piece of tissue during your colposcopy to check for cancer. This is known as a colposcopic biopsy. Other types of biopsies include: Endocervical curettage uses a thin instrument called a curette to scrape away cells Loop electro-surgical excision procedure ( LEEP) uses a thin wire heated by an electric current to remove cells Punch biopsy uses a tool called biopsy forceps to remove tissue Cone biopsy is another, more invasive, way for your doctor to take a tissue sample, so it's usually performed in a hospital. It can also treat some early-stage cervical cancers. Your doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix with either a LEEP, scalpel or laser. Cells taken from your cervix from any type of biopsy will be sent to a lab and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. You might have mild cramps and bleeding after these procedures. If your biopsy shows you have cervical cancer, the next step is to see if it has spread, and where. Your doctor might order one or more of these tests: Cystoscopy and proctoscopy. These tests both use a lighted tube to see if the cancer has spread into your bladder and rectum. CT scan. This powerful X-ray can show your doctor if your cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, liver, lungs, or other parts of your body. MRI. Your doctor might use an MRI to get very detailed images of inside your body. An MRI can find cancer that has spread to your pelvis, brain, or spinal cord. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will look to see if cancer has spread to your lungs. Positron emission tomography ( PET). Your doctor might order a PET scan if she thinks your cancer has spread but isn't sure where. It uses a type of radioactive sugar that cancer cells absorb. A special camera can spot the cells that have absorbed the sugar. After all of the tests results are back, your doctor will use them to determine if and how far your cancer has spread, which will show them what stage it is in. Staging classifies the cancer by how much is in your body and where it has spread when it's diagnosed. Knowing the stage can help your medical team plan the right treatment for you. Stages of cervical cancer are: Stage 0. Cancer is only on the surface of the cervix and have not grown into deeper tissues. Stage I. The cancer has grown into the cervix and may be growing into the body of the uterus. It may also have spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread distantly. Stage II. The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and uterus. It may have reached the upper part of the vagina. It may involve local lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage III. The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina or the walls of the pelvis. It may or may not involve the nearby lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage IV. This is the most advanced stage. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, like the bladder, rectum, lungs, liver, or distant lymph nodes.

The most important step to find precancerous cervical cells is getting screened. Tests can pick up changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Pap tests look for abnormal cells in your cervix that are starting to turn into cancer. Your gynecologist will perform a Pap test during your routine pelvic exam. It's quick and painless. You lie on an exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to keep your vagina open. It also lets her see your cervix. Next, she'll use a small brush to swab some cells from your cervix.

But if you're diagnosed with cervical cancer, know it's very treatable when your doctor finds it early. It's also one of the most preventable cancers in women because of available screenings and vaccinations. While regular screenings are the most important thing you can do to detect precancerous cells, there are other things you also need to know to spot symptoms early. The most important step to find precancerous cervical cells is getting screened. Tests can pick up changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Pap tests look for abnormal cells in your cervix that are starting to turn into cancer. Your gynecologist will perform a Pap test during your routine pelvic exam. It's quick and painless. You lie on an exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to keep your vagina open. It also lets her see your cervix. Next, she'll use a small brush to swab some cells from your cervix. The cells are sent a lab where they're checked for signs of cancer. Most women ages 21 to 65 need to be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap test every 3 years. You can get an HPV test alone or with your Pap test, known as co-testing, every five years starting after age 30. Human papilloma virus is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the high-risk types of the virus cause almost all cervical cancers. If you test positive for HPV, that doesn't mean you'll get cervical cancer. If you're over age 30, doctors recommend you get both tests every 3-5 years. Most women in the early stages of cervical cancer don't have any symptoms. That's why Pap and HPV screening tests are so important. Symptoms don't usually start until the cancer spreads to other organs and tissues. If you do have symptoms, you might notice: Abnormal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or after menopause) Heavier than normal periods Pain during sex Unusual vaginal discharge that might contain blood These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other diseases or infections cause them, too. See your gynecologist if you notice any of them. If you have an abnormal Pap test and other symptoms of cervical cancer, your gynecologist will want find out more about your medical history and your family's. She'll likely run more tests to find out if you have cancer cells in your cervix, and check your lymph nodes to see if cancer has spread. Some of the tests your gynecologist might use to check for cancer cells include: Colposcopy. During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix.

Stages of cervical cancer are: Stage 0. Cancer is only on the surface of the cervix and have not grown into deeper tissues. Stage I. The cancer has grown into the cervix and may be growing into the body of the uterus. It may also have spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread distantly. Stage II. The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and uterus. It may have reached the upper part of the vagina. It may involve local lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage III. The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina or the walls of the pelvis. It may or may not involve the nearby lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage IV.

It's also one of the most preventable cancers in women because of available screenings and vaccinations. While regular screenings are the most important thing you can do to detect precancerous cells, there are other things you also need to know to spot symptoms early. The most important step to find precancerous cervical cells is getting screened. Tests can pick up changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Pap tests look for abnormal cells in your cervix that are starting to turn into cancer. Your gynecologist will perform a Pap test during your routine pelvic exam. It's quick and painless. You lie on an exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to keep your vagina open. It also lets her see your cervix. Next, she'll use a small brush to swab some cells from your cervix. The cells are sent a lab where they're checked for signs of cancer. Most women ages 21 to 65 need to be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap test every 3 years. You can get an HPV test alone or with your Pap test, known as co-testing, every five years starting after age 30. Human papilloma virus is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the high-risk types of the virus cause almost all cervical cancers. If you test positive for HPV, that doesn't mean you'll get cervical cancer. If you're over age 30, doctors recommend you get both tests every 3-5 years. Most women in the early stages of cervical cancer don't have any symptoms. That's why Pap and HPV screening tests are so important. Symptoms don't usually start until the cancer spreads to other organs and tissues. If you do have symptoms, you might notice: Abnormal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or after menopause) Heavier than normal periods Pain during sex Unusual vaginal discharge that might contain blood These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other diseases or infections cause them, too. See your gynecologist if you notice any of them. If you have an abnormal Pap test and other symptoms of cervical cancer, your gynecologist will want find out more about your medical history and your family's. She'll likely run more tests to find out if you have cancer cells in your cervix, and check your lymph nodes to see if cancer has spread. Some of the tests your gynecologist might use to check for cancer cells include: Colposcopy. During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix. This liquid helps her see any abnormal cells. It might burn a little. Cervical biopsies. Your doctor might also remove a small piece of tissue during your colposcopy to check for cancer. This is known as a colposcopic biopsy. Other types of biopsies include: Endocervical curettage uses a thin instrument called a curette to scrape away cells Loop electro-surgical excision procedure ( LEEP) uses a thin wire heated by an electric current to remove cells Punch biopsy uses a tool called biopsy forceps to remove tissue Cone biopsy is another, more invasive, way for your doctor to take a tissue sample, so it's usually performed in a hospital. It can also treat some early-stage cervical cancers. Your doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix with either a LEEP, scalpel or laser. Cells taken from your cervix from any type of biopsy will be sent to a lab and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. You might have mild cramps and bleeding after these procedures. If your biopsy shows you have cervical cancer, the next step is to see if it has spread, and where. Your doctor might order one or more of these tests: Cystoscopy and proctoscopy. These tests both use a lighted tube to see if the cancer has spread into your bladder and rectum. CT scan. This powerful X-ray can show your doctor if your cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, liver, lungs, or other parts of your body. MRI. Your doctor might use an MRI to get very detailed images of inside your body. An MRI can find cancer that has spread to your pelvis, brain, or spinal cord. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will look to see if cancer has spread to your lungs. Positron emission tomography ( PET). Your doctor might order a PET scan if she thinks your cancer has spread but isn't sure where. It uses a type of radioactive sugar that cancer cells absorb. A special camera can spot the cells that have absorbed the sugar.

Your doctor might use an MRI to get very detailed images of inside your body. An MRI can find cancer that has spread to your pelvis, brain, or spinal cord. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will look to see if cancer has spread to your lungs. Positron emission tomography ( PET). Your doctor might order a PET scan if she thinks your cancer has spread but isn't sure where. It uses a type of radioactive sugar that cancer cells absorb. A special camera can spot the cells that have absorbed the sugar."]}

Psoriasis flares here can be more embarrassing, painful, and harder to treat. Some common ways to deal with psoriasis -- like managing your stress, not smoking, putting on moisturizer after a shower or bath, and getting plenty of rest -- are good for these areas, too. But others are too harsh for tender skin. You'll need to consider where your patches are when you make decisions about what to do. Keep these things in mind to protect your sensitive skin and make living with your psoriasis easier. Work closely with your doctor to find a way to control your symptoms. Let him know if anything you put on your skin burns or stings, or if you get an infection. Low-dose steroid cream. Doctors often prescribe it first because it's one of the best treatments. When you have an infection, the medicine to treat it might be mixed with a steroid. But you have to use steroids with care. Thin skin absorbs medicine more easily, so you're more likely to have side effects. A steroid cream can also make your skin even thinner and cause stretch marks or broken blood vessels if you use it too long. Your doctor will likely prescribe a low-dose steroid cream for a short time. Mild vitamin D creams. These have fewer long-term side effects than steroids, and you can use them longer. Sometimes they're mixed with a mild steroid to make them less irritating. Only use the one your doctor prescribes, since not all vitamin D creams work well for sensitive skin. Light treatments (phototherapy). UVB rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells and help many kinds of psoriasis. Artificial UVB light works on most parts of the body, but not your genitals. Moisturize. This is a key part of daily care for psoriasis on your whole body, including sensitive areas. A lighter texture is better for delicate skin. Go fragrance- and alcohol-free. Ceramides, lipids, and hyaluronic acid will help replace the natural moisturizers in your skin. Some people swear by oils like olive, coconut, and jojoba, too. Go soapless. Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry. Peeling creams. The best products to soften and remove scales have salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, or phenol. Some over-the counter ( OTC) peels may be too strong, so check with your doctor before you use them. Avoid peels on cracked or bleeding skin. Use an OTC antibiotic that you put on the area to help heal it. A light foundation makeup is often all you need. Even when you're trying to cover severe psoriasis, choose a formula specifically meant for your face. Pick something that's not too slippery, so it sticks to your skin, but not so dry that it makes flakes worse. Match your normal skin tone; don't go darker or lighter. You may have better luck finding items at a beauty products store. It might be worth it to have a makeup artist give you some tips about what things to use and how to apply them. For example, many professionals recommend using a primer after your moisturizer and before your foundation to help even out your skin. Since your hair can touch your face and neck, your styling products could be causing irritation. Look for fragrance- and alcohol-free ones. Products with fewer ingredients, that are natural rather than chemical, are safer. Wear loose-fitting clothes and underwear, like boxers or boy shorts. Tight clothes rub on sensitive skin and can make symptoms flare. Choose natural fabrics. Clothes made from cotton or silk are kinder to your skin than synthetics. Avoid scratchy wool. Change your clothes right after exercise so sweat doesn't stay close to your skin and irritate it. Although it may sound like a good idea, workout gear made of \"moisture-wicking\" fabrics might stick to affected skin. Sometimes, especially to the untrained eye, genital psoriasis can look like an STD. Assure your partner that your skin rash isn't contagious. Use non-latex condoms to avoid problems with psoriasis treatments that make latex condoms less effective. You can find them in most supermarkets and pharmacies. Lubricants can make sex more enjoyable for both men and women. Clean your genital area afterward, and apply more medication if you need to. Let your partner know when it's not comfortable to have sex, but don't shut them out. Tell them where you do want to be touched and what feels good to you. Extra pounds can create more skin folds where psoriasis could show up. When you're heavy, you're also more likely to sweat, which can make your symptoms worse.

Some common ways to deal with psoriasis -- like managing your stress, not smoking, putting on moisturizer after a shower or bath, and getting plenty of rest -- are good for these areas, too. But others are too harsh for tender skin. You'll need to consider where your patches are when you make decisions about what to do. Keep these things in mind to protect your sensitive skin and make living with your psoriasis easier. Work closely with your doctor to find a way to control your symptoms. Let him know if anything you put on your skin burns or stings, or if you get an infection. Low-dose steroid cream. Doctors often prescribe it first because it's one of the best treatments. When you have an infection, the medicine to treat it might be mixed with a steroid. But you have to use steroids with care. Thin skin absorbs medicine more easily, so you're more likely to have side effects. A steroid cream can also make your skin even thinner and cause stretch marks or broken blood vessels if you use it too long. Your doctor will likely prescribe a low-dose steroid cream for a short time. Mild vitamin D creams. These have fewer long-term side effects than steroids, and you can use them longer. Sometimes they're mixed with a mild steroid to make them less irritating. Only use the one your doctor prescribes, since not all vitamin D creams work well for sensitive skin. Light treatments (phototherapy). UVB rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells and help many kinds of psoriasis. Artificial UVB light works on most parts of the body, but not your genitals. Moisturize. This is a key part of daily care for psoriasis on your whole body, including sensitive areas. A lighter texture is better for delicate skin. Go fragrance- and alcohol-free. Ceramides, lipids, and hyaluronic acid will help replace the natural moisturizers in your skin. Some people swear by oils like olive, coconut, and jojoba, too. Go soapless. Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry. Peeling creams. The best products to soften and remove scales have salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, or phenol. Some over-the counter ( OTC) peels may be too strong, so check with your doctor before you use them. Avoid peels on cracked or bleeding skin. Use an OTC antibiotic that you put on the area to help heal it. A light foundation makeup is often all you need. Even when you're trying to cover severe psoriasis, choose a formula specifically meant for your face. Pick something that's not too slippery, so it sticks to your skin, but not so dry that it makes flakes worse. Match your normal skin tone; don't go darker or lighter. You may have better luck finding items at a beauty products store. It might be worth it to have a makeup artist give you some tips about what things to use and how to apply them. For example, many professionals recommend using a primer after your moisturizer and before your foundation to help even out your skin. Since your hair can touch your face and neck, your styling products could be causing irritation. Look for fragrance- and alcohol-free ones. Products with fewer ingredients, that are natural rather than chemical, are safer. Wear loose-fitting clothes and underwear, like boxers or boy shorts. Tight clothes rub on sensitive skin and can make symptoms flare. Choose natural fabrics. Clothes made from cotton or silk are kinder to your skin than synthetics. Avoid scratchy wool. Change your clothes right after exercise so sweat doesn't stay close to your skin and irritate it. Although it may sound like a good idea, workout gear made of \"moisture-wicking\" fabrics might stick to affected skin. Sometimes, especially to the untrained eye, genital psoriasis can look like an STD. Assure your partner that your skin rash isn't contagious. Use non-latex condoms to avoid problems with psoriasis treatments that make latex condoms less effective. You can find them in most supermarkets and pharmacies. Lubricants can make sex more enjoyable for both men and women. Clean your genital area afterward, and apply more medication if you need to. Let your partner know when it's not comfortable to have sex, but don't shut them out. Tell them where you do want to be touched and what feels good to you.

Ceramides, lipids, and hyaluronic acid will help replace the natural moisturizers in your skin. Some people swear by oils like olive, coconut, and jojoba, too. Go soapless. Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry. Peeling creams. The best products to soften and remove scales have salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, or phenol. Some over-the counter ( OTC) peels may be too strong, so check with your doctor before you use them. Avoid peels on cracked or bleeding skin. Use an OTC antibiotic that you put on the area to help heal it. A light foundation makeup is often all you need. Even when you're trying to cover severe psoriasis, choose a formula specifically meant for your face. Pick something that's not too slippery, so it sticks to your skin, but not so dry that it makes flakes worse. Match your normal skin tone; don't go darker or lighter. You may have better luck finding items at a beauty products store. It might be worth it to have a makeup artist give you some tips about what things to use and how to apply them. For example, many professionals recommend using a primer after your moisturizer and before your foundation to help even out your skin. Since your hair can touch your face and neck, your styling products could be causing irritation. Look for fragrance- and alcohol-free ones. Products with fewer ingredients, that are natural rather than chemical, are safer. Wear loose-fitting clothes and underwear, like boxers or boy shorts. Tight clothes rub on sensitive skin and can make symptoms flare. Choose natural fabrics. Clothes made from cotton or silk are kinder to your skin than synthetics. Avoid scratchy wool. Change your clothes right after exercise so sweat doesn't stay close to your skin and irritate it. Although it may sound like a good idea, workout gear made of \"moisture-wicking\" fabrics might stick to affected skin. Sometimes, especially to the untrained eye, genital psoriasis can look like an STD. Assure your partner that your skin rash isn't contagious. Use non-latex condoms to avoid problems with psoriasis treatments that make latex condoms less effective. You can find them in most supermarkets and pharmacies. Lubricants can make sex more enjoyable for both men and women. Clean your genital area afterward, and apply more medication if you need to. Let your partner know when it's not comfortable to have sex, but don't shut them out. Tell them where you do want to be touched and what feels good to you. Extra pounds can create more skin folds where psoriasis could show up. When you're heavy, you're also more likely to sweat, which can make your symptoms worse. Losing a few pounds may make a big difference to your comfort and the health of your skin.", "question": "What are common ways to deal with psoriasis?", "answer": ["Some common ways to deal with psoriasis -- like managing your stress, not smoking, putting on moisturizer after a shower or bath, and getting plenty of rest -- are good for these areas, too.

Keep these things in mind to protect your sensitive skin and make living with your psoriasis easier. Work closely with your doctor to find a way to control your symptoms. Let him know if anything you put on your skin burns or stings, or if you get an infection. Low-dose steroid cream. Doctors often prescribe it first because it's one of the best treatments. When you have an infection, the medicine to treat it might be mixed with a steroid. But you have to use steroids with care. Thin skin absorbs medicine more easily, so you're more likely to have side effects. A steroid cream can also make your skin even thinner and cause stretch marks or broken blood vessels if you use it too long. Your doctor will likely prescribe a low-dose steroid cream for a short time. Mild vitamin D creams. These have fewer long-term side effects than steroids, and you can use them longer. Sometimes they're mixed with a mild steroid to make them less irritating. Only use the one your doctor prescribes, since not all vitamin D creams work well for sensitive skin.

But do you know what the cholesterol test results actually mean? Read on to learn how to interpret the numbers. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance. Your liver makes all the cholesterol your body needs. But you take in more cholesterol from certain foods, such as those from animals. If you have too much cholesterol in your body, it can build up in the walls of your arteries (as \"plaque\") and eventually harden. This process, called atherosclerosis, actually narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to travel through the vessels. Unfortunately, high cholesterol doesn't cause symptoms. In later stages of atherosclerosis, though, you may suffer angina -- severe chest pain from lack of blood flow to the heart. If an artery gets totally blocked, a heart attack results. A routine blood cholesterol test is a far better way of finding out what your cholesterol level is. In addition to measuring the total cholesterol in your blood, the standard cholesterol test (called a \"lipid panel\") measures three specific kinds of fat: Low-density lipoproteins ( LDL). This is the \"bad cholesterol,\" the main cause of plaque build-up, which increases your risk for heart disease. In general, the lower the number, the better. But LDL cholesterol is only one part of a larger equation that measures a person's overall risk of having a heart attack or stroke. For years, guidelines focused on specific target numbers for individuals to achieve to lower their risk. The most recent guidelines focus on a person's overall risk and, based on that risk, recommend a certain percentage of LDL reduction as one part of a strategy for preventing serious heart and vascular problems. High-density lipoproteins ( HDL). This is the \"good cholesterol.\" It transports bad cholesterol from the blood to the liver, where it is excreted by the body. Your HDL is another part of the equation that identifies the risk of a cardiovascular event. In general, the higher the number the better, although, as with LDL, the emphasis has shifted from specific target numbers to strategies for reducing the overall risk. Triglycerides. Another type of fat in the bloodstream, triglycerides are also linked to heart disease. They are stored in fat cells throughout the body. If you have a lipoprotein profile, it's important to look at all the numbers from the cholesterol test, not just the total cholesterol number. That's because LDL and HDL levels are two primary indicators of potential heart disease. Use the information below to interpret your results (with the help of your doctor, of course). This will help you get a better idea about your risk for heart disease. Total blood cholesterol level: High risk: 240 mg/d L and above Borderline high risk: 200-239 mg/d L Desirable: Less than 200 mg/d L LDL cholesterol levels: 190 mg/d L and above represents a high risk for heart disease and is a strong indicator that the individual can benefit from intensive treatment, including life style changes, diet, and statin therapy for reducing that risk. For LDL levels that are equal to or less than 189 mg/d L, the guidelines recommend strategies for lowering LDL by 30% to 50% depending on what other risk factors you have that can affect the health of your heart and blood vessels. HDL cholesterol: High risk: Less than 40 mg/d L for men and less than 50 mg/d L for women Triglycerides: Very high risk: 500 mg/d L and above High risk: 200-499 mg/d L Borderline high risk: 150-199 mg/d L Normal: Less than 150 mg/d L If your doctor recommends a \"non-fasting\" cholesterol test, the lab will look only at your total cholesterol (and sometimes your HDL) numbers. For that test, you merely need to show up at the lab and have some blood drawn. If your doctor suggests a \"fasting\" cholesterol test (also called a \"lipid profile\"), the lab will analyze your levels of LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. For that test, you will need to fast nine to 12 hours before the blood test. Sometimes a doctor will ask you to do a non-fasting cholesterol test first. Depending on the results, he or she may then send you back for the more complete lipid profile. After reviewing your blood test, The doctor will also consider other risk factors you might have for heart disease, including: Your family history Age Weight Race Gender Diet Blood pressure and whether or not you're being treated for high blood pressure Activity level Smoking status History of diabetes Evidence of elevated blood sugars Then, your doctor will talk with you about your level of risk and the potential benefit to be derived by taking steps that include changes in your level of activity and diet as well as using medication to improve your cholesterol levels in order to reduce your overall risk.

For that test, you merely need to show up at the lab and have some blood drawn. If your doctor suggests a \"fasting\" cholesterol test (also called a \"lipid profile\"), the lab will analyze your levels of LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. For that test, you will need to fast nine to 12 hours before the blood test. Sometimes a doctor will ask you to do a non-fasting cholesterol test first. Depending on the results, he or she may then send you back for the more complete lipid profile.

But do you know what the cholesterol test results actually mean? Read on to learn how to interpret the numbers. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance. Your liver makes all the cholesterol your body needs. But you take in more cholesterol from certain foods, such as those from animals. If you have too much cholesterol in your body, it can build up in the walls of your arteries (as \"plaque\") and eventually harden. This process, called atherosclerosis, actually narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to travel through the vessels. Unfortunately, high cholesterol doesn't cause symptoms. In later stages of atherosclerosis, though, you may suffer angina -- severe chest pain from lack of blood flow to the heart. If an artery gets totally blocked, a heart attack results. A routine blood cholesterol test is a far better way of finding out what your cholesterol level is. In addition to measuring the total cholesterol in your blood, the standard cholesterol test (called a \"lipid panel\") measures three specific kinds of fat: Low-density lipoproteins ( LDL). This is the \"bad cholesterol,\" the main cause of plaque build-up, which increases your risk for heart disease. In general, the lower the number, the better. But LDL cholesterol is only one part of a larger equation that measures a person's overall risk of having a heart attack or stroke. For years, guidelines focused on specific target numbers for individuals to achieve to lower their risk. The most recent guidelines focus on a person's overall risk and, based on that risk, recommend a certain percentage of LDL reduction as one part of a strategy for preventing serious heart and vascular problems. High-density lipoproteins ( HDL). This is the \"good cholesterol.\" It transports bad cholesterol from the blood to the liver, where it is excreted by the body. Your HDL is another part of the equation that identifies the risk of a cardiovascular event. In general, the higher the number the better, although, as with LDL, the emphasis has shifted from specific target numbers to strategies for reducing the overall risk. Triglycerides. Another type of fat in the bloodstream, triglycerides are also linked to heart disease. They are stored in fat cells throughout the body. If you have a lipoprotein profile, it's important to look at all the numbers from the cholesterol test, not just the total cholesterol number. That's because LDL and HDL levels are two primary indicators of potential heart disease. Use the information below to interpret your results (with the help of your doctor, of course). This will help you get a better idea about your risk for heart disease. Total blood cholesterol level: High risk: 240 mg/d L and above Borderline high risk: 200-239 mg/d L Desirable: Less than 200 mg/d L LDL cholesterol levels: 190 mg/d L and above represents a high risk for heart disease and is a strong indicator that the individual can benefit from intensive treatment, including life style changes, diet, and statin therapy for reducing that risk.

But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional. Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication. Problems sleeping: The most common type of medication used to treat ADHD is stimulant drugs. These medications increase the levels of chemicals in the brain called dopamine and norepinephrine. That may cause your child to have problems falling asleep, especially when she first starts taking them. In many cases, the sleep problems can be fixed by changing what time the child takes the medication, or switching from a long-acting formula to one that wears off a few hours before bedtime. Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day. Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help. Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food. Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight. Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain. Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression. Bupropion has many of the same potential side effects as stimulants, including irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, and a worsening of existing tics.

If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain.

But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional. Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication. Problems sleeping: The most common type of medication used to treat ADHD is stimulant drugs. These medications increase the levels of chemicals in the brain called dopamine and norepinephrine. That may cause your child to have problems falling asleep, especially when she first starts taking them. In many cases, the sleep problems can be fixed by changing what time the child takes the medication, or switching from a long-acting formula to one that wears off a few hours before bedtime. Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day. Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help. Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food. Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight. Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner.

But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional. Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication. Problems sleeping: The most common type of medication used to treat ADHD is stimulant drugs. These medications increase the levels of chemicals in the brain called dopamine and norepinephrine. That may cause your child to have problems falling asleep, especially when she first starts taking them. In many cases, the sleep problems can be fixed by changing what time the child takes the medication, or switching from a long-acting formula to one that wears off a few hours before bedtime. Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day. Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help. Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food. Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight. Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain. Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression. Bupropion has many of the same potential side effects as stimulants, including irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, and a worsening of existing tics.

Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food. Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight. Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain. Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression.

Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain. Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression. Bupropion has many of the same potential side effects as stimulants, including irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, and a worsening of existing tics. At high doses, it may make some people more likely to have seizures and can cause hallucinations.", "question": "Is it normal for ADHD medicine to cause a loss in appetite?", "answer": ["Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward.

But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional. Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication. Problems sleeping: The most common type of medication used to treat ADHD is stimulant drugs. These medications increase the levels of chemicals in the brain called dopamine and norepinephrine. That may cause your child to have problems falling asleep, especially when she first starts taking them. In many cases, the sleep problems can be fixed by changing what time the child takes the medication, or switching from a long-acting formula to one that wears off a few hours before bedtime. Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day.

Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill.

High blood sugar can lead to other conditions, like eye problems. The most common one is diabetic macular edema. It's serious and can rob you of your vision. That's a scary possibility, but knowing what to look out for and getting the right treatment can help protect your sight. Even if you don't notice problems, when you have diabetes, it's important you get your eyes checked every year. If you do have a problem, see an ophthalmologist right away. This type of doctor treats eye diseases. If you catch it early, there's a chance you can stop long-term damage. High blood sugar weakens the blood vessels in your eyes. That can make them leak or grow out of control in your retina, the light-sensitive area at the back of your eye. This is called diabetic retinopathy. When fluid seeps into your retina, it can cause diabetic macular edema. The leaking makes your retina swell, which hampers the work of your macula, the special, sensitive part that gives you sharp vision. Diabetic macular edema doesn't always cause symptoms. But you may: Have images directly in front of you appear blurry or wavy See colors that seem âwashed outâ If this happens to you, see your doctor right away. Before any testing, your doctor may ask you questions: Have you noticed changes in your vision? If so, what kind? Have you been diagnosed with diabetes? If so, when? Does anyone in your family have it? How have your blood sugar and A1c levels been lately? Do you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Do you have any other medical conditions? You will need a thorough eye exam, which usually includes: A visual acuity test. It checks how well you see at different distances. A dilated eye exam. Your doctor will use drops to widen your pupils and look at the inside of your eyes. He'll look for signs of disease, including damaged or leaking blood vessels, swelling, and fatty deposits on the retina. If your doctor thinks you have diabetic macular edema, you may also need one or both of these tests: A fluorescein angiogram ( FA) takes pictures of your retina using a special dye that helps find any leaking blood vessels. The dye is injected into your arm, but travels quickly to your eye. Optical coherence tomography ( OCT) uses a special camera to photograph your retina. It is very sensitive and can find even small amounts of fluid and swelling. What is causing my symptoms? Will I lose my sight? Am I at risk for other eye diseases? Do you have experience treating diabetic macular edema? What type of treatment do you recommend for me? What can I expect from it? What else can I do to protect my vision? How often will I need to have my eyes checked? To treat diabetic macular edema, doctors may use drugs that are injected into your eyes to help stop leaking, and to slow the growth of new blood vessels. These drugs include: Avastin (bevacizumab) Eylea (aflibercept) Iluvien (fluocinolone acetonide) Lucentis (ranibizumab) Macugen (pegaptanib) In severe cases, you may also have laser photocoagulation. A doctor will use a tiny laser on your eye to seal leaking blood vessels. You may need more than one treatment to control the problem. It's usually not painful, but you may have slight stinging feeling when the laser touches you. Sometimes steroid injections may help. Another treatment is a surgery called vitrectomy. This is usually done because of bleeding (not macular edema), and doctors take out the fluid that is clouding your vision and replace it with a clear solution. There's a lot you can do to prevent your condition from getting worse. First, manage your diabetes by controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Diet changes, keeping a healthy weight, and exercise can all help you manage these problems. Talk with your doctor about the best way to do this. Also, don't sidestep regular eye exams. Symptoms can sneak up. Your doctor needs to see you to keep track of track of how your treatment is working. Have you already lost some vision? Talk to your doctor about visual aids, like magnifying glasses, if eyeglasses alone aren't enough. Ask him about resources in your area that can help you learn skills for living with vision loss. Treatment can help you protect your vision. It can greatly decrease your chance of losing your vision. Stay on top of your diabetes, and stick with your treatment plan.

Does anyone in your family have it? How have your blood sugar and A1c levels been lately? Do you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Do you have any other medical conditions?

Your doctor will use drops to widen your pupils and look at the inside of your eyes. He'll look for signs of disease, including damaged or leaking blood vessels, swelling, and fatty deposits on the retina. If your doctor thinks you have diabetic macular edema, you may also need one or both of these tests: A fluorescein angiogram ( FA) takes pictures of your retina using a special dye that helps find any leaking blood vessels.

To treat diabetic macular edema, doctors may use drugs that are injected into your eyes to help stop leaking, and to slow the growth of new blood vessels. These drugs include: Avastin (bevacizumab) Eylea (aflibercept) Iluvien (fluocinolone acetonide) Lucentis (ranibizumab) Macugen (pegaptanib) In severe cases, you may also have laser photocoagulation. A doctor will use a tiny laser on your eye to seal leaking blood vessels. You may need more than one treatment to control the problem. It's usually not painful, but you may have slight stinging feeling when the laser touches you. Sometimes steroid injections may help. Another treatment is a surgery called vitrectomy.

You feel like you might have diarrhea. Does this sound like you? Or, you had milk, mashed potatoes, or even candy almost 2 hours ago and have these symptoms. Does that sound like you? If either does, you could have lactose intolerance. Lactose is the main sugar in milk and most other dairy products. Your small intestine makes the enzyme lactase to help you digest that sugar. When you're lactose intolerant, you don't make enough lactase to digest lactose well. You can't cure lactose intolerance, but if you change what and how you eat, you may get rid of your symptoms. Millions of Americans have symptoms of lactose intolerance: Bloating Cramps Diarrhea Painful gas Nausea You can use trial and error to find out what foods cause symptoms, and in what amount. And then check in with your doctor for a diagnosis. You may be sensitive to small amounts of foods that have lactose, or you may only have symptoms if you eat a lot of lactose foods. Your symptoms may be severe or mild. Lactose intolerance is different for everyone. Milk and dairy products are the best-known lactose foods, but there are many others. Some nondairy products have a protein called casein, which can have traces of lactose. To avoid symptoms from lactose intolerance, read food labels carefully. When shopping or cooking, look for these ingredients that have lactose: Curds Dry milk solids Milk Milk byproducts Dry milk powder Whey If you are highly sensitive to lactose, you may need to avoid foods such as: Baked goods Bread, baking, and pancake mixes Breakfast cereals Certain types of candy, such as milk chocolate Instant foods (breakfast drink mixes, mashed potatoes, soups, and meal replacement drinks) Margarine Nondairy creamers (liquid and powdered) Nondairy whipped topping Processed meats (bacon, hot dogs, sausage, and lunch meats) Protein and meal replacement bars Salad dressing Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of the foods you eat, to note when you have symptoms, and to stop eating an offending food to see if your symptoms go away. To help make a diagnosis, some doctors simply look at your symptoms and whether avoiding dairy products for 2 weeks relieves them. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may do other tests, such as: Hydrogen breath test. Normally, people have very little hydrogen in their breath. If your body doesn't digest lactose, though, hydrogen builds in your intestines, and after a while it's in your breath. This test measures how much hydrogen is in your breath after you have a lactose-loaded drink several times in a few hours. If your levels are high 3 to 5 hours later, your body does not digest lactose well. Lactose tolerance test. When your body breaks down lactose, it releases sugar into your blood. This tests how much sugar is in your blood. After you fast, a small sample of blood is taken. Then, you drink a liquid that is high in lactose. Two hours later, you give another blood sample. Because lactose causes blood sugar levels to rise, your blood sugar levels in this sample should be higher. If you're lactose intolerant, you'll have just a low rise in blood sugar. You can't change how well your body digests lactose, but you can cut or even stop your symptoms. Talk with your doctor or a registered dietitian who can help you plan a healthy diet that keeps you feeling good. Keep a food diary to help you learn how much (if any) dairy you can eat without having symptoms. Many people don't need to stop eating all dairy. If you make small changes in what you eat, you may be able to prevent symptoms by helping your body digest dairy foods easier. Don't eat dairy alone. It's easier for your body to digest lactose when you eat it with other foods. So try having small amounts of milk or dairy foods with meals. Choose easier-to-digest dairy products. Some people find it easier to digest dairy products like cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese. Use lactose-free or reduced-lactose milk and dairy products. You can find dairy products with most of the lactose removed, or lactase added, at many grocery stores. Switch to dairy-free products. There are many nondairy options, such as almond, rice, or soy milks. Special note about infants and young children: When babies have symptoms of lactose intolerance, many children's doctors advise changing from cow's milk formula to soy milk formula until the symptoms go away, then slowly adding cow's milk formula and dairy products back into their diets. Take a lactase enzyme replacement. These are available over the counter in pills or capsules. Take the advised dose with your first drink or bite of dairy to help prevent lactose intolerance symptoms.", "question": "What foods should you avoid if you're highly sensitive to lactose?", "answer": ["When shopping or cooking, look for these ingredients that have lactose: Curds Dry milk solids Milk Milk byproducts Dry milk powder Whey If you are highly sensitive to lactose, you may need to avoid foods such as: Baked goods Bread, baking, and pancake mixes Breakfast cereals Certain types of candy, such as milk chocolate Instant foods (breakfast drink mixes, mashed potatoes, soups, and meal replacement drinks) Margarine Nondairy creamers (liquid and powdered) Nondairy whipped topping Processed meats (bacon, hot dogs, sausage, and lunch meats) Protein and meal replacement bars Salad dressing Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of the foods you eat, to note when you have symptoms, and to stop eating an offending food to see if your symptoms go away."]}

To help make a diagnosis, some doctors simply look at your symptoms and whether avoiding dairy products for 2 weeks relieves them. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may do other tests, such as: Hydrogen breath test. Normally, people have very little hydrogen in their breath. If your body doesn't digest lactose, though, hydrogen builds in your intestines, and after a while it's in your breath. This test measures how much hydrogen is in your breath after you have a lactose-loaded drink several times in a few hours. If your levels are high 3 to 5 hours later, your body does not digest lactose well. Lactose tolerance test. When your body breaks down lactose, it releases sugar into your blood. This tests how much sugar is in your blood. After you fast, a small sample of blood is taken. Then, you drink a liquid that is high in lactose. Two hours later, you give another blood sample. Because lactose causes blood sugar levels to rise, your blood sugar levels in this sample should be higher. If you're lactose intolerant, you'll have just a low rise in blood sugar. You can't change how well your body digests lactose, but you can cut or even stop your symptoms. Talk with your doctor or a registered dietitian who can help you plan a healthy diet that keeps you feeling good. Keep a food diary to help you learn how much (if any) dairy you can eat without having symptoms. Many people don't need to stop eating all dairy. If you make small changes in what you eat, you may be able to prevent symptoms by helping your body digest dairy foods easier. Don't eat dairy alone. It's easier for your body to digest lactose when you eat it with other foods. So try having small amounts of milk or dairy foods with meals. Choose easier-to-digest dairy products. Some people find it easier to digest dairy products like cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese. Use lactose-free or reduced-lactose milk and dairy products. You can find dairy products with most of the lactose removed, or lactase added, at many grocery stores. Switch to dairy-free products. There are many nondairy options, such as almond, rice, or soy milks. Special note about infants and young children: When babies have symptoms of lactose intolerance, many children's doctors advise changing from cow's milk formula to soy milk formula until the symptoms go away, then slowly adding cow's milk formula and dairy products back into their diets.

This is a process called fermentation. Bacteria turn the alcohol into acetic acid. That's what gives vinegar its sour taste and strong smell. Apple cider vinegar has a long history as a home remedy, used to treat things like sore throat and varicose veins. There isn't much science to support the claims. But in recent years, some researchers have been taking a closer look at apple cider vinegar and its possible benefits. Some people say the âmother,â the cloud of yeast and bacteria you might see in a bottle of apple cider vinegar, is what makes it healthy. These things are probiotic, meaning they might give your digestive system a boost, but there isn't enough research to back up the other claims. Vinegar is used in cooking, baking, and salad dressings and as a preservative. There's a lot of acid in it, so drinking vinegar straight isn't recommended. It can cause problems, like eroding the enamel of your teeth, if you get too much. If you're looking to use it for health reasons, most people say to add 1 to 2 tablespoons to water or tea. Vinegar has been used as a remedy for centuries. The ancient Greeks treated wounds with it. In recent years, people have explored apple cider vinegar as a way to lose weight, improve heart health, and even treat dandruff. Research doesn't back most of these claims. But some studies have found that the acetic acid may help with a variety of conditions: Japanese scientists found that drinking vinegar might help fight obesity. One small study found that vinegar improved blood sugar and insulin levels in a group of people with type 2 diabetes. Vinegar also has chemicals known as polyphenols. They help stop the cell damage that can lead to other diseases, like cancer. But studies on whether vinegar actually lowers your chances of having cancer are mixed. Because of its high acidity, drinking a lot of apple cider vinegar can damage your teeth, hurt your throat, and upset your stomach. Also: Though some studies have been promising, there's still little to prove that drinking apple cider vinegar helps you lose weight. It may also cause your potassium levels to drop too low. Your muscles and nerves need that nutrient to work the way they should. Another study of people with type 1 diabetes found that apple cider vinegar slows the rate food and liquids move out of your stomach to your intestines. Slower digestion makes it harder to control your blood sugar level. It might cause some medications to not work as well. These include diabetes and heart disease drugs as well as diuretics (medicines that help your body get rid of water and salt) and laxatives. And of course, its strong taste might not be for everyone. In short, apple cider vinegar probably won't hurt you. You can try it because it's calorie-free, adds lots of flavor to food, and has health benefits. But it isn't a miracle cure.", "question": "Medically speaking, what is apple cider vinegar?", "answer": ["Apple cider vinegar has a long history as a home remedy, used to treat things like sore throat and varicose veins.

People with OCD can have either obsessive thoughts and urges or compulsive, repetitive behaviors. Some have both obsessions and compulsions. OCD isn't about habits like biting your nails or always thinking negative thoughts. The disorder can affect your job, school, and relationships and keep you from living a normal life. Your thoughts and actions are beyond your control. An obsessive thought, for example, is to think that your family members might get hurt if they don't put their clothing on in the exact same order every morning. A compulsive habit, on the other hand, might be to wash your hands 7 times after touching something that might be dirty. Although you may not want to think or do these things, you feel powerless to stop. Many people with OCD know that their thoughts and habits don't make sense. They don't do them because they enjoy them, but because they can't quit. And if they do stop, they feel so bad that they start again. Obsessions and compulsions can involve many different things, like a need for order or cleanness, hoarding, and intrusive thoughts about sex, religion, violence, and body parts. Obsessive thoughts can include: Fear of germs or getting dirty Worries about getting hurt or others being hurt Need for things to be placed in an exact order Belief that certain numbers or colors are âgoodâ or âbadâ Constant awareness of blinking, breathing, or other body sensations Unfounded suspicion that a partner is unfaithful Compulsive habits can include: Washing hands many times in a row Doing tasks in a specific order every time, or a certain âgoodâ number of times Repetitive checking on a locked door, light switch, and other things Need to count things, like steps or bottles Putting items in an exact order, like cans with labels facing front Fear of touching doorknobs, using public toilets, or shaking hands Doctors aren't sure why some people have OCD. Certain areas in the brain may not look normal in people with OCD, but more research is needed. OCD is slightly more common in women than in men. Symptoms often appear in teens or young adults. Stress can make symptoms worse. There may be a gene or genes linked to OCD, but this is still unknown. You are more likely to get the disorder if you have: A parent, sibling, or child with OCD Depression, anxiety or tics Experience with trauma A history of physical or sexual abuse as a child Your doctor may do a physical exam and bloodwork to make sure that your symptoms aren't caused by something else. She will also talk with you about your feelings, thoughts, and habits. If your thoughts and habits keep you from doing what you want to do for at least an hour a day, you may have OCD. There's no cure for OCD. But with treatments, you may be able to lessen how much your symptoms interfere with your life. Your doctor may prescribe medicine, send you to talk therapy, called psychotherapy, or both.", "question": "How is obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnosed?", "answer": ["You are more likely to get the disorder if you have: A parent, sibling, or child with OCD Depression, anxiety or tics Experience with trauma A history of physical or sexual abuse as a child Your doctor may do a physical exam and bloodwork to make sure that your symptoms aren't caused by something else.

(â Idiopathicâ means that the cause isn't known.) It's best to work with a pediatric rheumatologist, a doctor who specializes in caring for children with arthritis and other joint problems. If there isn't one in your area, you can work with your child's pediatrician and a rheumatologist. Physical therapists, rehabilitation specialists called physiatrists, and occupational therapists can also help. The doctor will recommend a treatment plan to ease swelling, maintain full movement in the affected joints, relieve pain, and identify, treat, and prevent complications. Most children with JRA need medication and physical therapy to reach these goals. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), including ibuprofen and naproxen, and other prescription drugs, are often the first type of medication used. Most doctors don't treat children with aspirin because it could cause bleeding problems, stomach upset, liver problems, or Reye's syndrome. But for some children, aspirin in the correct dose, measured by blood tests, can control JRA symptoms with few serious side effects. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs) are often used if NSAIDs don't provide enough relief. DMARDs may keep JRA from getting worse. But because they take weeks or months to relieve symptoms, they're often taken with an NSAID. Methotrexate is usually the main DMARD doctors prescribe for JRA. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may help children with severe JRA. These drugs can help stop serious symptoms such as inflammation of the lining around the heart (pericarditis). Doctors can give children these medicines for JRA directly into the vein, into joints, or by mouth. Steroids can hamper a child's normal growth and can cause other side effects, such as a round face, weight gain, weakened bones, and a greater chance of infection. Biologic drugs, which are genetically engineered, may be used in children if other drugs don't work. Injectables include adalimumab ( Humira), abatacept ( Orencia), tocilizumab ( Actemra), etanercept ( Enbrel), and canakinumab ( Ilaris). Biologics suppress the overactive immune system, targeting proteins that trigger inflammation. Your child's JRA treatment should include physical therapy. It helps keep their muscles strong so that their joints can move as well as possible. A physiatrist or a physical therapist can create an exercise program for your child. The specialist also may recommend using splints and other devices to help maintain normal bone and joint growth. Some alternative or complementary approaches for JRA, such as acupuncture, may help a child handle some of the stress of living with an ongoing illness. The National Institutes of Health ( NIH) considers acupuncture an acceptable additional treatment for arthritis. Studies show it eases pain, may lower the need for painkillers, and can boost flexibility in affected joints. But it doesn't stop joint damage from getting worse with some forms of JRA.

Start with 20-30 minutes of aerobic activity -- anything that gets your heart rate up. Do that 5 days a week, and your overall numbers may drop while your good cholesterol will rise. The best part? You reap the benefits of exercise even if you don't lose weight. Aerobic activity (\"cardio\") offers the best results. Find things you enjoy, and have a backup plan for those days when your first choice isn't possible. If you haven't been active in a long time, check with your doctor first.

Stronger muscles burn more calories all day, not just after a workout. And burning calories results in weight loss, which lowers triglycerides. If you've never lifted weights, learn proper form from a professional so you don't hurt yourself. Don't stress if it's hard to get in a 30-minute workout every day. \" You don't necessarily have to set aside a period of time when you put on your jogging shoes and sweatpants and go running,\" says Robert Bonow, MD, former president of the American Heart Association. \" You can just be active throughout the day.\" Start gradually. Squeeze in 10 minutes of exercise, and build up to several times a day. Here are a few ways to add some activity into your schedule: Stand up and pace whenever you talk on the phone or while you watch TV. Challenge yourself to keep adding in steps until you get up to 10,000 steps a day. Wear a pedometer all day to track your steps. Find an app for your smartphone that offers a 10-minute workout.

The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, defines complementary and alternative medicine as a \"group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.\" Complementary medicine is used with conventional treatments, whereas alternative medicine is used instead of conventional medicine. Although some may be effective, others aren't or can even be harmful. If you want to try complementary or alternative medicine, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons and what may be a good idea for you. Acupuncture is a procedure where a practitioner inserts very thin needles into specific points on your skin. Some scientists say that acupuncture triggers the release of the body's natural painkillers. Acupuncture has been shown to offer relief from chronic pain and is sometimes used by people with neuropathy, the painful nerve damage that can happen with diabetes. Biofeedback is a technique that helps you become more aware of -- and learn to deal with -- your body's response to pain. This therapy emphasizes relaxation and stress-reduction techniques. Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that some professionals who use biofeedback also practice. With guided imagery, you'll think of peaceful mental images, such as ocean waves, or perhaps images of controlling or curing your disease. People using this technique say these positive images can ease their condition. The benefit of taking chromiumhas been studied and debated for several years. You need the mineral to make glucose tolerance factor, which helps insulin work better. Several studies suggest that chromium supplements may improve diabetes control, but we don't have enough information to recommend it to treat diabetes yet. Several types of plants are referred to as ginseng, but most studies have used American ginseng. They've shown some sugar-lowering effects in fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, as well as in A1c results (average blood sugar levels over a 3-month period). But we need larger and more long-term studies. Researchers also found that the amount of sugar-lowering compound in ginseng plants varies widely. Although the relationship between magnesiumand diabetes has been studied for decades, we still don't fully understand it. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. And evidence suggests that a magnesium deficiency may contribute to some diabetes complications. People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. Early studies showed that vanadium normalized blood sugar levels in animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When people with diabetes were given vanadium, they had a modest increase in insulin sensitivity and were able to lower their need for insulin. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages. Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control. Most plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. People with type 2 diabetes may focus on: Brewer's yeast Buckwheat Broccoli and other related greens Cinnamon Cloves Coffee Okra Leafy greens Fenugreek seeds Sage Some studies show that certain plant foods may help your body fight inflammation and use insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Cinnamon extracts can improve sugar metabolism, triggering insulin release, which also boosts cholesterol metabolism. Clove oil extracts (eugenol) have been found to help insulin work and to lower glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. An unidentified compound in coffee (not caffeine) may enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The scientific evidence thus far doesn't support the role of garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle for blood sugar control in people with diabetes. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first. Since being overweight and having diabetes are linked, many people with diabetes turn to natural alternative therapies that claim to help with weight loss, including: Chitosan Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) Chromium Pyruvate Germander Momordica charantia ( Chinese bitter melon) Sauropus androgynus (sweet leaf bush) Aristolochic acid There are also skin patch (transdermal) systems as well as oral sprays that supposedly curb your appetite and make it easier to lose weight. What's the bottom line? Check with your doctor, because many of these so-called \"obesity remedies\" haven't been studied, aren't effective, or just aren't safe. In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke. Chitosan comes from seashells and can bind to fat to prevent absorption. Studies thus far haven't been encouraging for weight loss though. Germander, Momordica charantia, Sauropus androgynus, and aristolochic acid have been linked with liver disease, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease. A survey of herbal preparations for obesity found that many had lead or arsenic and other toxic metals. Some also had other ingredients that weren't included on the label. And sometimes, the wrong plant was listed.

The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, defines complementary and alternative medicine as a \"group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.\" Complementary medicine is used with conventional treatments, whereas alternative medicine is used instead of conventional medicine. Although some may be effective, others aren't or can even be harmful. If you want to try complementary or alternative medicine, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons and what may be a good idea for you. Acupuncture is a procedure where a practitioner inserts very thin needles into specific points on your skin. Some scientists say that acupuncture triggers the release of the body's natural painkillers. Acupuncture has been shown to offer relief from chronic pain and is sometimes used by people with neuropathy, the painful nerve damage that can happen with diabetes. Biofeedback is a technique that helps you become more aware of -- and learn to deal with -- your body's response to pain. This therapy emphasizes relaxation and stress-reduction techniques. Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that some professionals who use biofeedback also practice. With guided imagery, you'll think of peaceful mental images, such as ocean waves, or perhaps images of controlling or curing your disease. People using this technique say these positive images can ease their condition. The benefit of taking chromiumhas been studied and debated for several years. You need the mineral to make glucose tolerance factor, which helps insulin work better. Several studies suggest that chromium supplements may improve diabetes control, but we don't have enough information to recommend it to treat diabetes yet. Several types of plants are referred to as ginseng, but most studies have used American ginseng. They've shown some sugar-lowering effects in fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, as well as in A1c results (average blood sugar levels over a 3-month period). But we need larger and more long-term studies. Researchers also found that the amount of sugar-lowering compound in ginseng plants varies widely. Although the relationship between magnesiumand diabetes has been studied for decades, we still don't fully understand it. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. And evidence suggests that a magnesium deficiency may contribute to some diabetes complications. People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. Early studies showed that vanadium normalized blood sugar levels in animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When people with diabetes were given vanadium, they had a modest increase in insulin sensitivity and were able to lower their need for insulin. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages. Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control. Most plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. People with type 2 diabetes may focus on: Brewer's yeast Buckwheat Broccoli and other related greens Cinnamon Cloves Coffee Okra Leafy greens Fenugreek seeds Sage Some studies show that certain plant foods may help your body fight inflammation and use insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Cinnamon extracts can improve sugar metabolism, triggering insulin release, which also boosts cholesterol metabolism. Clove oil extracts (eugenol) have been found to help insulin work and to lower glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. An unidentified compound in coffee (not caffeine) may enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The scientific evidence thus far doesn't support the role of garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle for blood sugar control in people with diabetes. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first. Since being overweight and having diabetes are linked, many people with diabetes turn to natural alternative therapies that claim to help with weight loss, including: Chitosan Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) Chromium Pyruvate Germander Momordica charantia ( Chinese bitter melon) Sauropus androgynus (sweet leaf bush) Aristolochic acid There are also skin patch (transdermal) systems as well as oral sprays that supposedly curb your appetite and make it easier to lose weight. What's the bottom line? Check with your doctor, because many of these so-called \"obesity remedies\" haven't been studied, aren't effective, or just aren't safe. In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke. Chitosan comes from seashells and can bind to fat to prevent absorption. Studies thus far haven't been encouraging for weight loss though. Germander, Momordica charantia, Sauropus androgynus, and aristolochic acid have been linked with liver disease, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease. A survey of herbal preparations for obesity found that many had lead or arsenic and other toxic metals. Some also had other ingredients that weren't included on the label. And sometimes, the wrong plant was listed. You should talk to your doctor about any drugs, herbal products, or alternative and complementary treatments to make sure they're not going to interfere with your treatment or cause other problems.

In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke. Chitosan comes from seashells and can bind to fat to prevent absorption. Studies thus far haven't been encouraging for weight loss though. Germander, Momordica charantia, Sauropus androgynus, and aristolochic acid have been linked with liver disease, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease. A survey of herbal preparations for obesity found that many had lead or arsenic and other toxic metals. Some also had other ingredients that weren't included on the label. And sometimes, the wrong plant was listed.

Biofeedback is a technique that helps you become more aware of -- and learn to deal with -- your body's response to pain. This therapy emphasizes relaxation and stress-reduction techniques. Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that some professionals who use biofeedback also practice. With guided imagery, you'll think of peaceful mental images, such as ocean waves, or perhaps images of controlling or curing your disease. People using this technique say these positive images can ease their condition. The benefit of taking chromiumhas been studied and debated for several years. You need the mineral to make glucose tolerance factor, which helps insulin work better. Several studies suggest that chromium supplements may improve diabetes control, but we don't have enough information to recommend it to treat diabetes yet. Several types of plants are referred to as ginseng, but most studies have used American ginseng. They've shown some sugar-lowering effects in fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, as well as in A1c results (average blood sugar levels over a 3-month period). But we need larger and more long-term studies. Researchers also found that the amount of sugar-lowering compound in ginseng plants varies widely. Although the relationship between magnesiumand diabetes has been studied for decades, we still don't fully understand it. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. And evidence suggests that a magnesium deficiency may contribute to some diabetes complications. People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. Early studies showed that vanadium normalized blood sugar levels in animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When people with diabetes were given vanadium, they had a modest increase in insulin sensitivity and were able to lower their need for insulin. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages. Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control. Most plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. People with type 2 diabetes may focus on: Brewer's yeast Buckwheat Broccoli and other related greens Cinnamon Cloves Coffee Okra Leafy greens Fenugreek seeds Sage Some studies show that certain plant foods may help your body fight inflammation and use insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Cinnamon extracts can improve sugar metabolism, triggering insulin release, which also boosts cholesterol metabolism. Clove oil extracts (eugenol) have been found to help insulin work and to lower glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. An unidentified compound in coffee (not caffeine) may enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The scientific evidence thus far doesn't support the role of garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle for blood sugar control in people with diabetes.

When people with diabetes were given vanadium, they had a modest increase in insulin sensitivity and were able to lower their need for insulin. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages. Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control. Most plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. People with type 2 diabetes may focus on: Brewer's yeast Buckwheat Broccoli and other related greens Cinnamon Cloves Coffee Okra Leafy greens Fenugreek seeds Sage Some studies show that certain plant foods may help your body fight inflammation and use insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Cinnamon extracts can improve sugar metabolism, triggering insulin release, which also boosts cholesterol metabolism. Clove oil extracts (eugenol) have been found to help insulin work and to lower glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. An unidentified compound in coffee (not caffeine) may enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The scientific evidence thus far doesn't support the role of garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle for blood sugar control in people with diabetes. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first. Since being overweight and having diabetes are linked, many people with diabetes turn to natural alternative therapies that claim to help with weight loss, including: Chitosan Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) Chromium Pyruvate Germander Momordica charantia ( Chinese bitter melon) Sauropus androgynus (sweet leaf bush) Aristolochic acid There are also skin patch (transdermal) systems as well as oral sprays that supposedly curb your appetite and make it easier to lose weight. What's the bottom line? Check with your doctor, because many of these so-called \"obesity remedies\" haven't been studied, aren't effective, or just aren't safe. In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke. Chitosan comes from seashells and can bind to fat to prevent absorption. Studies thus far haven't been encouraging for weight loss though. Germander, Momordica charantia, Sauropus androgynus, and aristolochic acid have been linked with liver disease, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease. A survey of herbal preparations for obesity found that many had lead or arsenic and other toxic metals. Some also had other ingredients that weren't included on the label. And sometimes, the wrong plant was listed. You should talk to your doctor about any drugs, herbal products, or alternative and complementary treatments to make sure they're not going to interfere with your treatment or cause other problems. Beware of claims that seem too good to be true. Look for scientific-based sources of information. The National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse collects resource information for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK) Reference Collection, a service of the National Institutes of Health. To learn more about alternative therapies for diabetes treatment, contact the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Select brands of natural products carefully -- \"natural\" doesn't automatically mean it's good for you. Avoid products made with more than one herb. Read labels: Look for the herb's common and scientific name, the name and address of the manufacturer, a batch and lot number, expiration date, dosage guidelines, and potential side effects. Stop taking the product and call your doctor right away if you: Feel queasy or throw up Have a fast heartbeat Feel more anxious, worried, or unsettled than usual Can't sleep Get diarrhea Get skin rashes", "question": "How does coenzyme Q10 help with type 2 diabetes?", "answer": ["Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood.

Or do you need a prescription? Both prescribed and OTC drugs are regulated by the FDA to ensure that they're safe and effective when you follow the directions. But all medications have side effects. Some medications can cause problems when you're taking other medicines, too. Given all the options and things to consider, it's best to work with your doctor or allergy specialist to figure out whether an OTC or prescription medication is right for you. You'll want to tell them about your symptoms and any medicines you've tried in the past. You don't need a prescription to buy OTC medicine. For the medications that you think of as prescription, you do. Sometimes, the same drug comes in both OTC and prescription versions. The difference is often the strength. For example, hydrocortisone can treat skin reactions including itching and redness. If you're bothered by an insect bite, you can get an OTC cream or spray with a concentration of 1% or less. But for a more severe reaction like eczema, your doctor may prescribe 2.5% hydrocortisone cream or ointment. In other cases, a prescription medication works in a different way than what you can buy over the counter. If you have hay fever, you can treat the sneezing and stuffy, itchy nose with an OTC antihistamine such as cetirizine ( Zyrtec), fexofenadine ( Allegra), or loratadine ( Claritin). These block chemicals called histamines, which your body releases when your allergy is triggered. Or your doctor could prescribe a medication like montelukast ( Singulair), which blocks a different chemical so your body won't react as much. Another difference might be how long it takes for you to feel better. Those OTC antihistamines typically start working in about an hour, but it may be a couple of days before the prescription really kicks in. Most OTC medicines, including antihistamines and nasal steroids, are safe to use as directed for as long as your symptoms last, but there are some exceptions. Don't use a decongestant nasal spray for more than 3 days unless your doctor says to. It could stop working and make your stuffiness worse. Talk to your doctor about other potential risks. One study found a link between dementia and using high doses of some OTC antihistamines for many years, such as diphenhydramine ( Benadryl). When your allergies could be life-threatening or get in the way of living your life, you should see a specialist, called an allergist. You may need a prescription if your allergy symptoms are: Several months out of the year Causing a stuffy nose, trouble breathing, or sinus infections that won't go away Affecting your day-to-day activities Not controlled by OTC medications, or those medicines cause unpleasant side effects If you're taking a prescription medicine for your allergies, ask your doctor before you also take an OTC medication, especially an antihistamine, for those same symptoms. Using some medicines together can cause more side effects or even set off a dangerous reaction. Tell your doctor about everything you take: all the pain relievers, remedies, vitamins, and supplements, too. Your doctor might also write a prescription for an OTC medicine so that it's covered by your health insurance. You'll need to check the rules for your plan -- your copay and your flexible spending account or your health savings account -- to figure out what's going to cost less. Kids may be able to use the same OTC products as adults, but in smaller doses. Follow the directions on the label. Some OTC medicines are made specifically for children, like antihistamine syrups and chewable tablets. Call your child's doctor or check with a pharmacist if you have any questions.", "question": "When do you need a prescription to buy over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medicines?", "answer": ["You don't need a prescription to buy OTC medicine.

And because there's no cure, getting the proper treatment early is the best way to improve chances of managing the illness. Schizophrenia treatment will center on managing the person's symptoms. To do that, they'll probably need to take medication for an open-ended period of time, possibly even for life. Psychotherapy, a kind of talk therapy, will likely also be a big part of the plan to help them understand and manage their symptoms. There's more than one kind of psychotherapy and many types of medications, so you'll want to know what's involved. Individual psychotherapy . During sessions, a therapist or psychiatrist can teach the person how to deal with their thoughts and behaviors. They'll learn more about their illness and its effects, as well as how to tell the difference between what's real and what's not. It also can help them manage everyday life. Cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT). This can help the person change their thinking and behavior. A therapist will show them ways to deal with voices and hallucinations. With a combination of CBT sessions and medication, they can eventually tell what triggers their psychotic episodes (times when hallucinations or delusions flare up) and how to reduce or stop them. Cognitive enhancement therapy ( CET). This type of therapy is also called cognitive remediation. It teaches people how to better recognize social cues, or triggers, and improve their attention, memory, and ability to organize their thoughts. It combines computer-based brain training and group sessions. If a person with schizophrenia sees improvement during psychotherapy sessions, it's likely they'll need more help learning how to become part of a community. That's where psychosocial therapy comes in. Social skills training. This type of instruction focuses on improving communication and social interactions. Rehabilitation. Schizophrenia usually develops during the years we are building our careers. So rehabilitation may include job counseling, problem-solving support, and education in money management. Family education. Your knowledge of psychosis and schizophrenia can help a friend or family member who has it. Research shows that people with schizophrenia who have a strong support system do better than those without the encouragement of friends and family. Self-help groups. You should encourage your loved one to participate in community care and outreach programs to continue working on his social skills. The National Alliance on Mental Illness ( NAMI) is an outreach organization that offers a free peer-to-peer program, for instance. It includes 10 sessions for adults with mental illness who want to learn more about their condition from people who have experienced it themselves or been through it with a loved one. Coordinated specialty care ( CSC). This is for people experiencing an episode of psychosis for the first time. It's a team approach that combines medication and psychological therapies. It includes social and employment services and tries to include the family whenever possible. The aim is to change the direction and prognosis for the disease by catching it in its earliest stages. Research shows that people with schizophrenia who get early and intensive treatment have the best long-term results. Assertive community treatment ( ACT). This offers highly personalized services to help people with schizophrenia meet life's daily challenges, like taking medications. ACT professionals also help them handle problems proactively and work to prevent crises. Social recovery therapy. This treatment puts the focus on helping the person set and achieve goals and building a sense of optimism and positive beliefs about themselves and others. These newer medications are less likely to cause certain side effects than the first-generation antipsychotics. But many medications in this family can cause weight gain and raise blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Changes in nutrition and exercise, and possibly medication intervention, can help address these side effects.

While they're under general anesthesia, doctors send a small electric shock to the brain. A course of ECT therapy usually involves 2-3 treatments per week for several weeks. Each shock treatment causes a controlled seizure. A series of treatments over time leads to improvement in mood and thinking. Scientists don't fully understand exactly how ECT and the controlled seizures it causes help, although some researchers think that ECT-induced seizures may affect the release of neurotransmitters in the brain.

He'll probably start with questions about your medical history. Then he'll do a physical exam of your hands, arms, shoulders, and neck. He'll try to figure out if your pain is due to another condition, like an injury or arthritis. He'll also make sure your daily activities aren't to blame. The doctor may focus on your wrist to see if the area is tender, swollen, warm, or discolored. He'll probably test each finger to see if you've lost any feeling. And he'll check the strength of the muscles in your hand. After that, he may do or order any of the following tests. They'll focus on the median nerve, which runs through your forearm into your hand. When that nerve gets pressed or squeezed through the carpal tunnel, it causes carpal tunnel syndrome. The doctor will tap or press on the median nerve in your wrist with a reflex hammer. If your fingers tingle or if you feel an electric-shock-like sensation, the test is positive. You may have carpal tunnel syndrome. This is also known as the wrist-flexion test. The doctor will tell you to press the backs of your hands and fingers together with your wrists flexed and your fingers pointed down. You'll stay that way for 1-2 minutes. If your fingers tingle or get numb, you have carpal tunnel syndrome. This means you can tell if two objects touching your skin are two distinct points instead of just one. Your doctor may use a gadget called a 2-point disk-criminator, a small, flat, eight-sided tool with needle-like prongs sticking out from all sides. He might do the test several times on each finger. He'll start with two points touching your skin a few centimeters apart and move them closer together until you feel just one point of pressure. The distance at which you can feel only one point will help him figure out nerve function and compression -- two important components of carpal tunnel syndrome. This test provides some of the strongest evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome. It measures how fast an electric signal can travel along a nerve or from the nerve to a muscle. The doctor places a small electrode on your skin near your elbow. It sends a mild electrical current down your median nerve.

The needle sends electric impulses into the muscle. You relax and flex your hand several times. The doctor can tell if your median nerve is damaged or being squeezed. The needles might hurt a little, but it should stop once the doctor takes them out. You may feel twitches or spasms from the electrical current. You could have some bruising where the electrode went in, but that should go away within a few days. Your doctor may order one of these tests to rule out other causes of wrist and hand pain. An X-ray can show arthritis or a broken bone. An ultrasound or MRI will show a swollen or compressed median nerve.

But how cautious should you be about germs and illness when traveling with kids in the U. S.? Experts agree that a few major precautions, like washing hands frequently, are critical to keeping nasty germs from making children ill while traveling. But beyond those, how careful you are about germs on the road depends on how careful you are about germs at home. If you don't mind your children crawling around in other people's homes, it's probably not a big deal for them to crawl around in a hotel as long as you check first for safety hazards and wash their hands afterward. But what if the thought of your child touching a hotel room floor or snuggling up in an airplane blanket makes you feel ill? You may be more comfortable taking more measures, experts say. And some children are just more prone to illness when traveling than others. In either case, you'll probably feel more comfortable taking extra care. Here are some strategies you can use to help keep illness at bay when traveling with healthy children. If you are planning to travel with a newborn infant or a child with a compromised immune system, talk to your child's doctor first about special precautions. Are children more vulnerable to illness when traveling? Yes, and experts point to two main reasons: Most children are not particularly good about keeping things out of their mouths, and they aren't particularly careful with hand hygiene. In addition, children's immune systems are less developed than those of adults, and this makes them more vulnerable to illness. These three strategies can help protect them: Make sure your child is up to date on immunizations, even when traveling in the U. S. Be sure your child has had routine vaccinations for measles, whooping cough, and other serious illnesses on the normal CDC schedule. And anyone in your travel party who hasn't gotten a yearly flu shot should consider getting one before heading out. The CDC recommends an annual flu shot for everyone six months old and older. A flu shot provides double benefits. It protects your child and helps cut down on the general level of flu being transmitted. Practice good hand hygiene. Washing hands often, especially before meals, is the No. 1 way to prevent illness, at home or while traveling. Of course, you should help small children wash hands and teach older kids how to wash them thoroughly. Using warm soap and water, lather up and scrub all over for 20 seconds, then rinse and dry. While you're at it, encourage your kids not to put dirty hands -- or other things -- in their mouth. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Children should wash their hands with soap and water when they can, but you should have a sanitizing gel or wipes with at least 60% alcohol available when soap and water aren't. This is especially important in places where it may be difficult to get to a restroom, such as at amusement parks or even on airplanes. Make sure children rub hand sanitizer all over their hands until dry. If you can see dirt on their hands, however, hand sanitizers won't be enough. Hand sanitizers are dangerous for children if they swallow any, so store them in a bag safely away from small children, and supervise their use. Airplanes have gotten a reputation as flying cold-and-flu factories. But it's actually hard to determine just what role they play in making children, or adults, sick during travel. Experts agree that when kids have more contact with other people, they're more likely to get sick. But that can happen anywhere there are lots of people -- including malls, restaurants, or rest stops. Concerns about airplane germs often focus on air quality. A 2008 study of cabin-air bacteria in 12 commercial airplanes showed, though, they do not pose a risk for healthy passengers. And experts say your risk of getting a respiratory infection is higher on a bus or in an airport than on a plane. A bigger concern, according to some experts, is airplane surfaces. The majority of infections, including respiratory infections, are passed by contact occurring within a very short distance rather than through the air. Consider these measures if you're concerned about airplane germs: Sanitize \"high touch\" areas. Germs linger longer on nonporous materials like plastic. Wipe down surfaces such as tray tables, seat armrests, and lavatory door handles with an alcohol-based wipe or gel before your child uses them. With the short cleaning time between flights, these areas do not always get cleaned and disinfected. Avoid touching restroom surfaces. When washing your child's hands in an airplane or other public restroom, turn off the faucet with a paper towel. Then use another paper towel to dry hands and open the door. Bring your own blankets and pillows. If airplane blankets or pillows aren't delivered to you in a package, chances are they've been used. Having a familiar blanket and pillow to curl up with may also make children more comfortable during air travel. Drink bottled water. In water quality tests on 158 airplanes in 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA) discovered coliform bacteria and E. coli in some water samples. In 2009, the EPA established tougher rules for airplane water. Generally, however, the numbers of food- and water-borne illnesses from airplane travel are low. Ask sick passengers near you to observe cold and flu etiquette. If someone near you isn't covering coughs or sneezes, ask him to, even if it makes you feel awkward to do so. And be sure you do the same. Also, make sure your child coughs or sneezes into a tissue or her elbow and washes her hands afterward. Put distance between your child and sick passengers. Ask the flight attendant if you and your child can move to another row. If that's not possible, take the seat next to the sick person instead of putting your child there. You're likely to be more conscious of what you touch and how to prevent infection. Hotels. One study found that when people with colds stayed overnight in hotel rooms, many surfaces remained contaminated with rhinovirus for at least a day. But how concerned should you be? Health experts point out that most hotel rooms are better cleaned than most homes. Towels and sheets are changed daily, and the room is cleaned somewhat every day. Still, experts suggest wiping down remote controls, light switches, telephones, doorknobs, toilet seat handles, faucet handles, and other high-touch areas as a precaution when traveling with children. Amusement parks. Be careful what you eat. Avoid food that may have been sitting out for a long time. Since you can't wipe down germy surfaces at amusement parks, hand hygiene is especially important. Swimming pools and water parks. Have kids rinse off before and after taking the plunge at pools and water parks. These can be breeding grounds for pinkeye (conjunctivitis), skin viruses, and cryptosporidium and giardia, which cause diarrhea. Chlorination does not kill all bacteria. Also teach young children to avoid swallowing water in pools and water parks. Too many treats, not enough sleep, and being on the go can wear down children's immunity. This can make them more vulnerable to illness. These strategies can help kids stay healthy on the road: Encourage children to drink liquids. Stick closely to your child's normal, healthy diet. This not only gives kids nutrients to help fight infection -- it can also help prevent diarrhea or constipation, which children are prone to when traveling. Consider bringing your kids' favorite healthy foods on road trips or airplanes instead of buying fast food or snacks. Don't skimp on sleep. Sticking to your children's normal bedtime and naptime will help them sleep better. Packing favorite stuffed animals or blankets can also help children sleep in strange places so they get enough rest. Whatever strategies you use to keep harmful bacteria at bay, try to keep germs and illness in perspective. It's not uncommon for healthy children, especially under age 5, to get several colds a year -- and usually not from strangers on the road. Most often infections come from the people we love.", "question": "How can you avoid hotel germs when you travel?", "answer": ["Health experts point out that most hotel rooms are better cleaned than most homes.

You might feel like people won't understand what you're dealing with. But there are good ways to handle any stress and keep yourself feeling good. You may have spent years trying to hide your symptoms, and think they're too embarrassing to talk about. But people who care about you are an important source of support. Be open with your family and close friends about what you feel, physically and emotionally. It's natural to fear what others might say. But keeping things inside only adds to your stress. Also, consider other ways to handle your situation: See a professional counselor for help with your feelings and to find ways to handle stress. Look for a support group or online forum. You can share your experience with people who know what you're going through. They may have tips on how to deal with the things you're worried about. Plan how you'd like to explain your condition to an acquaintance or respond to a comment from a stranger. Practice saying it to family or friends until you feel comfortable. It may help to let people know that HS isn't contagious and has nothing to do with bad hygiene. For some people, HS brings feelings of anger, anxiety, and depression. It can be hard to stop negative thoughts once they start. Try these strategies: Acknowledge your feelings. Notice what emotions you're having, and know that it's OK to feel them. Learn your triggers. Pay attention to the things that bring on negative thoughts and emotions. Maybe you can avoid them. Challenge negative thoughts. Ask yourself if you might be wrong, or if there's another way to look at the issue. Be kind to yourself. Think about what you'd tell your best friend if she said the same things about herself. Don't turn to alcohol, drugs, or food for comfort. It can take someone years to find out that they have hidradenitis suppurativa. Some people are too embarrassed to talk to their doctor about their symptoms. It's also easy to mistake HS for a different skin problem. Getting the right diagnosis can be a relief. It can also be hard to find the right treatment. Be open with your doctor about your symptoms and how they affect your daily life. It may help to write down what you want to talk about. And speak up if you don't get relief. You may need to find a doctor who specializes in HS. HS can bring unpredictable flare-ups. Take positive steps to feel more in control: Get to a healthy weight. People who are obese are more likely to have HS. Losing weight can keep it in check. It also lowers your chances of having other health problems and may help you feel better in general. Stop smoking. Watch what you eat. Ask your doctor if any specific foods might make your HS worse. Exercise. Even if you may have pain and trouble moving, stay as active as possible. Exercise can slow HS down and make you feel better. Many people find swimming keeps them fit and also soothes their skin. Care for yourself. Keep track of what helps your HS and what seems to make it worse, and come up with a plan to manage your flare-ups.

You might have: Loss of appetite Nausea Discomfort in your belly Dark urine Clay-colored bowel movements Yellowing of the skin and eyes (called jaundice) If you have long-term hepatitis C, it could lead to scarring of your liver, called cirrhosis. You get it by eating or drinking something that's got the virus in it. You get it when blood from someone who's infected gets into your body. For instance, you can catch it if you share needles when using illegal drugs. You can also get hepatitis B if you have sex without using a condom with someone who's got it. If you're pregnant and you've got hepatitis B, you could pass it to your child during birth. Like hepatitis B, you get this type when the blood of someone who's infected enters your body. This can happen through sharing needles when using illegal drugs. An infected mother can also give the disease to her newborn child during birth. The hepatitis A virus can live outside the body for months. Hepatitis B survives for at least 7 days while still being able to cause an infection. Hepatitis C can live outside the body for up to 4 days and still spread the disease. Studies show that a vaccine will prevent the disease for at least 20 years. But booster doses aren't routinely recommended. If you have long-term hepatitis B you might be a \"carrier,\" which means you can infect others. No. If for some reason you stop your vaccines in the middle of the series, you can resume with the next dose. Medicines for this disease include: Adefovir, dipivoxil ( Hepsera) Entecavir ( Baraclude) Lamivudine ( Epivir- HBV) Interferon alfa-2b ( Intron A) Pegylated interferon alfa-2a ( Pegasys) Telbivudine ( Tyzeka) Tenofovir ( Viread) Before the drugs we now have available, the typical treatment was a combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. But new medicines have come out in recent years that do not require interferon, are generally well tolerated, and cure more people. Your treatment will depend on many things including what type of hepatitis C virus you have. In the U. S., the most common is genotype 1, followed by genotypes 2 and 3.

Millions of Americans do. You may just need glasses, especially if you're nearsighted. On the other hand, it could mean that you have cataracts or other issues. If you're afraid to hit the road after dark because you can't see, let your doctor know. A wide range of conditions -- from sun exposure to diabetes -- makes it hard to see at night: Cataracts . Your eye's lens is right behind the pupil. As you age, cells grow and die inside it. That builds up debris and leads to cataracts. They don't hurt, but they do get worse and slowly cloud your lens. The first symptom is often worse night vision. Because cataracts distort the light that comes into your eyes, you may see halos around lights -- again, mostly at night. Blurry vision is also common. Lack of vitamin A. It's found in carrots and leafy vegetables. It helps keep the retina -- the back of your eye where images are focused -- healthy. Most Americans get enough vitamin A in their diets, but if you have a health issue that makes it hard for you to absorb nutrients ( Crohn's disease, celiac disease, gastric bypass), you might have night vision problems. Not enough zinc. Without it, vitamin A may not work as well as it should. The result: night blindness. Beef, poultry, beans, and nuts are rich sources. Most people in the U. S. get plenty of it from their food. Retinitis pigmentosa. This rare genetic disorder affects young people, usually before age 30. A decline in night vision is often the earliest symptom. Some people lose all their sight. Others keep some vision. Sunlight exposure. Prolonged exposure to sunlight is a major risk factor for cataract development, is a major cause for poor night vision. Always wear your sunglasses when you're out in the sun to help prevent this. LASIK surgery problems. Complications after LASIK surgery are uncommon. But a few people have night vision problems after it. Complaints include glare and halos around objects, both of which distort vision. You may have symptoms during the day, too.

So ask your doctor to check to see if you're at risk. Diabetes . It makes you more likely to have night vision problems. Over years, high blood sugar damages the blood vessels and nerves in your eyes, which leads to a condition called retinopathy. If you have trouble seeing in low light, either indoors or outside, talk to your doctor. A simple exam and conversation at an eye doctor's office can show the cause of your night blindness. The doctor will use drops to open your eyes up wide (he'll call this dilation). Then he'll look into them with a slit-lamp, an upright microscope with a bright light on it. What you can do for night blindness depends on the cause. Cataracts are removed surgically. The doctor will replace your clouded natural lens with a clear artificial model known as an intraocular lens. Most people have much better vision afterward, but some still need glasses. Diabetic retinopathy is easy to prevent if you keep tight control of blood sugar levels with medicines and diet. One treatment uses a laser to destroy the tiny blood vessels that threaten your vision. This process, called panretinal photocoagulation, will preserve your overall sight but could reduce your night vision. Lack of vitamin A or zinc aren't common causes of night blindness.

Your eye's lens is right behind the pupil. As you age, cells grow and die inside it. That builds up debris and leads to cataracts. They don't hurt, but they do get worse and slowly cloud your lens.

Or you might assume that you're definitely going to get diabetes. Not so! You do need to take prediabetes seriously, but there's still time to turn things around -- if you start now. The goal is to get your blood sugar level out of the prediabetes range, and keep it that way. What you do every day makes a big difference. Making lifestyle changes may be even more powerful than just taking medication. That's what happened in a large study called the Diabetes Prevention Program: People with prediabetes who lost a small amount of weight through diet and exercise cut their odds of getting type 2 diabetes by 58%, compared to 31% for people who only took the prescription drug metformin. Start by making these three changes. If you're overweight, slimming down is the key to turning the odds in your favor. Research shows that shedding just 5% to 10% of your body weight is often enough to get blood sugar levels back into the normal range and avoid diabetes or at least delay its onset. To reach your goal, limit portion sizes; cut calories; and eat fewer foods that are high in fat (especially saturated fat), sugar, and carbohydrates. You should also eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Leading an active life is a must. Aim for 30 minutes of aerobic activity (something that raises your heart rate, like walking, biking, or swimming) 5 days a week (150 minutes per week). Plus, do some strength-training exercise, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, at least twice a week. Strength work builds muscle, which helps lower your blood sugar level, helps your body respond better to insulin (which controls blood sugar), and burns calories even when you're not moving. Smoking is strongly linked to diabetes: People who smoke are 30% to 40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who don't. And people with diabetes who continue smoking are more likely to develop complications such as heart disease and blindness. So the sooner you ditch the cigarettes, the better. While lifestyle changes can work wonders, some people with prediabetes also need medication. Your doctor may prescribe metformin if you have certain risk factors, such as low levels of HDL (\"good\") cholesterol, high triglycerides (a type of blood fat), a parent or sibling with diabetes, or are overweight.

You're more likely to have high triglycerides if you are overweight, don't exercise, have diabetes, have increased waist circumference, or have a family history of high triglycerides. That's true for men and women alike. Hypothyroidism, lupus, and treatment with corticosteroids can also raise triglyceride levels. Women are more likely to get high triglycerides if they: Take birth control pills that include estrogen Are pregnant; pregnancy can temporarily raise triglyceride levels. Have been through menopause Have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), a hormonal disorder in which women have higher levels of male hormones; PCOS can also raise the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes. Take oral estrogens or hormone replacement therapy Take prescription drugs such as tamoxifen or, to a lesser degree, raloxifene ( Evista) that target estrogen levels; doctors call this class of drugs \" SERMs,\" which stands for \"selective estrogen receptor modulators.\" Your lifestyle can make a big difference in your triglyceride levels. Ask your doctor what lifestyle changes you should make, the best ways to do that, and how long it will take to make a difference in your triglyceride levels.
