The grief process is normal, and most people go through it. But when grief takes over your life and you begin to feel hopeless, helpless, and worthless, then it's time to talk to your doctor about telling the difference between normal grief and depression. Grief is a natural response to death or loss. The grieving process is an opportunity to appropriately mourn a loss and then heal. The process is helped when you acknowledge grief, find support, and allow time for grief to work. Each year, between 5% and 9% of the population loses a close family member. But that's not the only kind of loss that can cause grief. People can feel loss when: They become separated from a loved one They lose a job, position, or income A pet dies or runs away Kids leave home They have a major change in life such as getting a divorce, moving, or retiring While we all feel grief and loss, and each of us is unique in the ways we cope with our feelings. Some people have healthy coping skills. They're able to feel grief without losing sight of their daily responsibilities. Other people don't have the coping skills or support they need. That hinders the grieving process. There are specific stages of grief. They reflect common reactions people have as they try to make sense of a loss. An important part of the healing process is feeling and accepting the emotions that come as a result of the loss. People go through common stages of grief: Denial, numbness, and shock: Numbness is a normal reaction to a death or loss and should never be confused with \"not caring.\" This stage of grief helps protect us from experiencing the intensity of the loss. It can be useful when we have to take some action, such as planning a funeral, notifying relatives, or reviewing important papers. As we move through the experience and slowly acknowledges its impact, the initial denial and disbelief fades. Bargaining: This stage of grief may be marked by persistent thoughts about what \"could have been done\" to prevent the death or loss. Some people become obsessed with thinking about specific ways things could have been done differently to save the person's life or prevent the loss. If this stage of grief isn't dealt with and resolved, the person may live with intense feelings of guilt or anger that can interfere with the healing process. Depression: In this stage, we begin to realize and feel the true extent of the death or loss. Common signs of depression in this stage include trouble sleeping, poor appetite, fatigue, lack of energy, and crying spells. We may also have self-pity and feel lonely, isolated, empty, lost, and anxious. Anger: This stage is common. It usually happens when we feel helpless and powerless. Anger can stem from a feeling of abandonment because of a death or loss. Sometimes we're angry at a higher power, at the doctors who cared for a lost loved one, or toward life in general. Acceptance: In time, we can come to terms with all the emotions and feelings we experienced when the death or loss happened. Healing can begin once the loss becomes integrated into our set of life experiences. Throughout our lives, we may return to some of the earlier stages of grief, such as depression or anger. Because there are no rules or time limit to the grieving process, everyone's healing process will be different. Some things can impede or slow down the healing process following a death or loss. They include: Avoiding emotions Compulsive behaviors Minimizing feelings Overworking on the job Misusing drugs, alcohol, or other substances as a way to deal with emotional discomfort Acknowledge and accept both positive and negative feelings. Allow plenty of time to experience thoughts and feelings. Confide in a trusted person about the loss. Express feelings openly or write journal entries about them. Find bereavement groups in which there are other people who've had similar losses. Remember that crying can provide a release. Seek professional help if feelings are overwhelming. If grief continues and causes a prolonged and deep depression with physical symptoms such as poor sleep, loss of appetite, weight loss, and even thoughts of suicide, you may have a condition known as complicated bereavement. Talk with your doctor as soon as possible. Sometimes, a major depression can develop along with the normal feelings of loss or sadness linked with grief. Whereas normal sadness as part of a grief reaction may subside after several months, major depression is a medical disorder that is different from normal grief, can occur at any time (even in the immediate aftermath of a death of loss), and requires treatment to be resolved.", "question": "Can a doctor help me tell the difference between grief and depression?", "answer": ["The grief process is normal, and most people go through it.

You may have had a small hole in it or something more severe. Although these can be very serious conditions, many can be treated with surgery. In some cases, doctors can find these problems during pregnancy. You might not get symptoms until adulthood, or you may not get any at all. Doctors don't always know why a baby has a congenital heart defect. They tend to run in families. Things that make them more likely include: Problems with genes or chromosomes in the child, such as Down syndrome Taking certain medications, or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy A viral infection, like rubella ( German measles) in the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy Most congenital heart problems are structural issues like holes and leaky valves. For instance: Heart valve defects: One may be too narrow or completely closed. That makes it hard for blood to get through. Sometimes, it can't get through at all. In other cases, the valve might not close properly, so the blood leaks backward. Problems with the heart's \"walls\": It could be the ones between the chambers (atria and ventricles) of your heart. Holes or passageways between the left and right side of the heart might cause blood to mix when it shouldn't. Issues with the heart's muscle: These can lead to heart failure, which means the heart doesn't pump as efficiently as it should. Bad connections among blood vessels: In babies, this may let blood that should go to the lungs go to other parts of the body instead, or vice versa. These defects can deprive blood of oxygen and lead to organ failure. It's possible for you to have a heart-related birth defect and not have symptoms. If you do, they can include: Shortness of breath Problems with exercise The symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and children may include: A bluish tint to the skin, fingernails, and lips (doctors call this cyanosis, a condition caused by a lack of oxygenated blood) Fast breathing and poor feeding Poor weight gain Lung infections An inability to exercise Doctors may find some problems before a baby is born. Other problems may be found in infants, kids, or adults. The doctor listens to your heartbeat to check your health. If she hears an unusual sound or heart murmur, she might order more tests, such as: Echocardiogram: A type of ultrasound that takes pictures of your heart. There are different kinds, so ask your doctor what you can expect. Cardiac catheterization: A doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. She puts dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart. Chest X-ray: These can reveal signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG): This measures the heart's electrical activity. MRI : You get a scan that lets doctors see the heart's structure. You might not need any treatment. Or you may need medications, surgery, or other procedures. If you have congenital heart disease, you'll need to see a heart specialist on a regular basis. People with congenital heart defects are more likely to have inflammation of the inner layer of their heart (a condition doctors call endocarditis), especially if their heart was repaired or replaced through surgery. To protect yourself: Tell all doctors and dentists you have congenital heart disease. You may want to carry a card with this information. Call your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection (sore throat, general body aches, fever). Take good care of your teeth and gums to prevent infections. Make regular visits to your dentist. Take antibiotics before you have any medical work that may cause bleeding, like dental work and most surgeries.

Early research shows benefits for this hard-to-treat form of cancer. Mesothelioma often starts in your pleura, a thin lining between your lung and the inside of your chest. Usually, it affects people who've breathed in asbestos, a material used in roofing and insulation. Tiny asbestos fibers go into your lungs and cause cancer cells to grow in the lining. Right now, the only FDA-approved mesothelioma treatments are chemotherapy, like cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pemetrexed. Doctors are looking at other options, like immunotherapy, that could offer hope. Where Is Immunotherapy Now? Larger clinical trials with more mesothelioma patients will offer a better look at how well immunotherapy works and what side effects it can cause. These drugs are being studied for mesothelioma now: Atezolizumab ( Tecentriq) Durvalumab ( Imfinzi) Ipilimumab ( Yervoy) Nivolumab ( Opdivo) Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) Tremelimumab How Does Immunotherapy Work? Unlike chemotherapy drugs, which kill both cancer and healthy cells, immunotherapy is more targeted. It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer. White blood cells in your immune system spot cells that aren't supposed to be in your body, like bacteria or viruses. Immunotherapy drugs tell the white blood cells to sense certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells, then seek out and destroy those cells. Block the Blocker It sounds simple, but in mesothelioma, these proteins can block your immune system's attack. They're called checkpoints. They distract your white blood cells so they don't attack the cancer inside. Checkpoint proteins include PD-1 and PD- L1. Immunotherapy drugs like atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab are called checkpoint inhibitors because they block the proteins' defense. Checkpoints normally act as an off switch for immune cells attacking tumor cells. Immunotherapy reveals the tumor cells. The checkpoint inhibitor pulls the mask off so the immune cells can do their job. When Is It Used? Mesothelioma is hard to treat because its tumor cells are high in checkpoints. So current trials test different mixes of immunotherapy drugs, as well as use of immunotherapy to rev up your immune system before cancer surgery. The results: People who've failed other treatments often respond well to immunotherapy. Right now, immunotherapy is mainly given to people with mesothelioma in clinical trials.. So how and when do you know if you should sign up for one? Every trial is different. Each has its own requirements for who can enroll based on the type of mesothelioma you have and what treatments you've already tried that didn't work. You and your doctor can talk about immunotherapy when you're diagnosed and go over your treatment options. The type of mesothelioma you have and how far it has spread will help you decide if you should try chemotherapy or surgery first. Usually, you go into a drug trial if other treatments have failed. But some mesothelioma immunotherapy trials don't require that. How Do You Take Immunotherapy? These drugs are all given as infusions, so you go to a clinic to get an IV drip every 2 to 3 weeks. Immunotherapy can cause side effects including diarrhea, nausea, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, and inflamed organs. Next Steps Researchers want to find biomarkers, like genes or those proteins on the tumors, that could help immunotherapy drugs better hit their targets. Also, most people don't respond to a single drug, so scientists are looking into combinations with surgery, other cancer drugs, and other immunotherapies. More trials on more patients with mesothelioma may tell us how well they work in different types of this cancer, and why they seem to work when other drugs have failed. Doctors will go back and figure out why people had the response they did, whether it was partial or very good. One day, you might not have to wait until other treatments fail first to try immunotherapy. If things keep going the way they are, it could soon become a front-line treatment for mesothelioma.", "question": "How does cancer immunotherapy work?", "answer": ["It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer.

The good news is that lifestyle changes and drug treatments usually help fight the types of vascular disease that can cause erectile dysfunction. Usually, a vascular disease happens when cholesterol and other substances build up and block blood vessels. In some men, the arteries and veins in the penis, and the rest of the body, may not work properly. They may keep blood from flowing when they're not supposed to. Some common health conditions are linked with vascular disease and clogged arteries: Coronary artery disease (clogged arteries in the heart) High blood pressure Diabetes High cholesterol Obesity Peripheral vascular disease, which affects the blood vessels that send blood to the arms, hands, legs, and feet If you have one of these conditions, it's more likely that the problem can affect the blood vessels in your penis and cause erectile dysfunction. Also, smoking greatly raises your chances for clogged arteries and vascular disease. If you have erectile dysfunction, it helps to kick the habit. Your penis must store blood to keep an erection. If the veins can't keep blood there during an erection, you'll lose it. This is called venous leak. It may happen with vascular disease.

This means you'll get more than one treatment at the same time to attack the cancer cells. Years ago, the main weapons that doctors used to fight cancer were surgery, chemotherapy (strong medicine that kills healthy cells along with cancer cells), and radiation. Today, there are many new tools, like immunotherapy, which boosts your body's own immune system to help it fight cancer, and targeted therapy, which targets and attacks certain mutated genes or proteins that are in some forms of cancer without harming normal cells. Often, when doctors combine two or more ways fight cancer, they have a greater result than when they use only one cancer-fighting weapon at a time. This type of treatment lets them attack cancer from many angles at the same time, so there are fewer places for it to hide. This makes it more likely that the treatments will help. Your doctor will decide what type is best for you based on your health and the type of melanoma you have. He'll also choose the best option to try first. Some treatments may never be right for you, if your form of melanoma doesn't have certain mutated genes or proteins. You may have more severe side effects than if you only got one treatment at a time. Your doctor may choose to stop one if the side effects are too severe. He may also stop a treatment if you don't improve by a certain time. Your doctor may suggest these combinations: Research has shown that using two drugs to treat stage IV melanoma works better than using just one. Cancer can trick your immune system into leaving it alone. These meds âwake upâ your body so you can fight back. When ipilimumab ( Yervoy) is paired with either nivolumab ( Opdivo) or pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) survival rates are better than treating with ipilimumab alone. Your doctor will know whether or not this drug combo is right for you. You could be more likely to have a serious heart problem or other severe side effects than if you only took one of the drugs. Some of today's newer cancer treatments target certain mutated genes or proteins that cancer needs to thrive or survive. If your melanoma has them, you can take a medication to attack them. About half the people with melanoma have a change to their genes called BRAF. Other people have a certain protein called MEK that helps melanoma grow and thrive. If your cancer has them, the doctor may give you a mix of binimetinib ( Mektovi) and encorafenib ( Braftovi), dabrafenib ( Tafinlar) and trametinib ( Mekinist) or two other drugs called cobimetinib ( Cotellic) andvemurafenib ( Zelboraf).

Your back is at the mercy of bad habits like: Slouching at your desk Lifting and pulling heavy objects with your back rather your legs Being overweight Not exercising enough Smoking Wearing high heels Carrying an overloaded backpack All of these things can lead to lower back pain. You may carry your stress in your back -- the muscles feel like they're in knots. And the pain can feel much worse if you're also depressed or anxious. Falling down, getting into a car accident, or even overdoing it in that pick-up game over the weekend can cause problems you feel in your lower back, like: Spine/vertebral fractures: Your back may have a broken bone if it gets hit hard or you fall from a great height. Sprains and strains: Lifting and twisting at the same time, or swinging a golf club, can pull or tear the ligaments, muscles, and tendons in your back. Spasms: These are muscle contractions, and they hurt. They generally happen when you sprain or strain your lower back. In many cases, the pain happens when parts of the back -- the spine, joints, tissues, muscles, and the discs that cushion the spinal bones (vertebrae) -- are out of sync. If your back isn't feeling quite right, have your doctor check for: Herniated or slipped discs: The bones of your spine are cushioned by discs, often referred to as âshock absorbers.â When they wear down, the soft tissue between them begins to squeeze out. This is when you start to feel it -- especially if they rupture. It can happen if you've had a sudden injury, or because of simple wear and tear. Bulging discs: The stuff inside your discs âbulges,â but not as much as with a herniated disc. They often cause no symptoms on their own, but they can bring pain if the disc pushes up against a nerve root. Degenerative disc disease: The discs that separate your vertebrae wear down. This sometimes causes the bones to rub together. Age is usually the reason, but sports and injuries can be culprits, too.

Spondylolisthesis: If your doctor mentions this, a bone in the spine has slipped out of place, probably in your lower back. This can be seen by X-ray or MRI. Spinal stenosis: This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that causes pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. It's usually from arthritis or bony growth from wear and tear.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm: If the blood vessel that supplies blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs is at risk of rupturing, you'll feel sudden pain in your lower back.

Your back is at the mercy of bad habits like: Slouching at your desk Lifting and pulling heavy objects with your back rather your legs Being overweight Not exercising enough Smoking Wearing high heels Carrying an overloaded backpack All of these things can lead to lower back pain. You may carry your stress in your back -- the muscles feel like they're in knots. And the pain can feel much worse if you're also depressed or anxious. Falling down, getting into a car accident, or even overdoing it in that pick-up game over the weekend can cause problems you feel in your lower back, like: Spine/vertebral fractures: Your back may have a broken bone if it gets hit hard or you fall from a great height. Sprains and strains: Lifting and twisting at the same time, or swinging a golf club, can pull or tear the ligaments, muscles, and tendons in your back. Spasms: These are muscle contractions, and they hurt. They generally happen when you sprain or strain your lower back. In many cases, the pain happens when parts of the back -- the spine, joints, tissues, muscles, and the discs that cushion the spinal bones (vertebrae) -- are out of sync. If your back isn't feeling quite right, have your doctor check for: Herniated or slipped discs: The bones of your spine are cushioned by discs, often referred to as âshock absorbers.â When they wear down, the soft tissue between them begins to squeeze out. This is when you start to feel it -- especially if they rupture. It can happen if you've had a sudden injury, or because of simple wear and tear. Bulging discs: The stuff inside your discs âbulges,â but not as much as with a herniated disc. They often cause no symptoms on their own, but they can bring pain if the disc pushes up against a nerve root. Degenerative disc disease: The discs that separate your vertebrae wear down. This sometimes causes the bones to rub together. Age is usually the reason, but sports and injuries can be culprits, too. Inflammation and movement problems of the sacroiliac joint: This joint sits at the bottom of the spine, on either side of the pelvis. It transfers the weight of your upper body to your lower body. This can start to bother you after you've been injured, if you have an infection, if you have arthritis, or if you're pregnant. Abnormal movement, such as too much movement of the joint, can also cause long-term pain. Lumbar spinal stenosis : If you're over age 60, there's a decent chance this is your culprit. As you age, your spinal canal narrows. That change can put pressure on the nerves running through your spine. Your shoulders and legs will then start to feel numb. Cauda equina syndrome: This happens if a ruptured disc pushes down into the nerve roots in your spine.

Cervical radiculopathy : This is a pinched nerve in your neck that is usually caused by a bone spur or herniated disc.

Bulging discs: The stuff inside your discs âbulges,â but not as much as with a herniated disc. They often cause no symptoms on their own, but they can bring pain if the disc pushes up against a nerve root. Degenerative disc disease: The discs that separate your vertebrae wear down. This sometimes causes the bones to rub together. Age is usually the reason, but sports and injuries can be culprits, too. Inflammation and movement problems of the sacroiliac joint: This joint sits at the bottom of the spine, on either side of the pelvis. It transfers the weight of your upper body to your lower body. This can start to bother you after you've been injured, if you have an infection, if you have arthritis, or if you're pregnant. Abnormal movement, such as too much movement of the joint, can also cause long-term pain. Lumbar spinal stenosis : If you're over age 60, there's a decent chance this is your culprit. As you age, your spinal canal narrows. That change can put pressure on the nerves running through your spine. Your shoulders and legs will then start to feel numb. Cauda equina syndrome: This happens if a ruptured disc pushes down into the nerve roots in your spine. It may be what's causing your pain if bladder and bowel control have been an issue for you lately. Cervical radiculopathy : This is a pinched nerve in your neck that is usually caused by a bone spur or herniated disc. Sciatica: This may be your cause if you have a sharp pain in your lower back or hip. It happens when a herniated disc presses on the nerves in your lower spine. Arthritis: This causes stiffness, swelling, and inflammation in your joints. If your doctor mentions âankylosing spondylitis,â he's talking about a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the joints and ligaments along your spine. Osteoarthritis : This is when your cartilage and bone begin to break down and there is inflammation. Scoliosis: You may hear this called âcurvature of the spine.â If you have it, chances are you were born with it. Pain tied to it usually starts at about middle age. Spondylolisthesis: If your doctor mentions this, a bone in the spine has slipped out of place, probably in your lower back. This can be seen by X-ray or MRI. Spinal stenosis: This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that causes pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. It's usually from arthritis or bony growth from wear and tear. Lower back pain can also be caused by other things that are going on in your body. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: If the blood vessel that supplies blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs is at risk of rupturing, you'll feel sudden pain in your lower back. Pregnancy: All that weight out front can put a real strain on your back. Tumors: They usually don't start in the back, but are part of the spread of a cancer in the spine that started somewhere else in your body. Infections: Osteomyelitis, discitis and, septic sacroiliitis are uncommon infections that affect the bones, discs, and joints of the spine. Any one of these can cause pain in your lower back. Kidney infections can also cause your back to feel the brunt. Other issues: Low back pain can also happen because of things like: Kidney stones Endometriosis, a buildup of uterine tissue outside the uterus Fibromyalgia, a condition that causes widespread muscle pain", "question": "What are herniated or slipped discs and how can they cause back pain?", "answer": ["If your back isn't feeling quite right, have your doctor check for: Herniated or slipped discs: The bones of your spine are cushioned by discs, often referred to as âshock absorbers.â When they wear down, the soft tissue between them begins to squeeze out.

They make it hard for your child's body to remove waste products as he digests proteins. They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child. In most cases, you can manage them with diet and medications. When your baby eats protein, his body breaks it down into amino acids and uses what he needs. What he doesn't need is further broken down into waste products that his body removes. This happens in a process called the urea cycle. Your baby's liver makes things called enzymes that turn waste nitrogen into urea. The urea leaves his body in his urine. If your child has a urea cycle disorder, his liver can't make one of the enzymes the cycle needs. When his body can't remove nitrogen, ammonia forms and collects in his blood. It's toxic and can cause brain damage or put him in a coma. It can even be fatal if you don't treat it quickly. UCDs affect about 1 in 30,000-35,000 newborns. There are eight types. They're named after what's missing from the urea cycle. You'll also hear doctors call them by their initials: ARG1 deficiency -- Arginase ASL deficiency -- Argininosuccinate lyase ASS1 deficiency -- Argininosuccinate synthase 1 Citrin deficiency -- Citrin CPSI deficiency -- Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I NAGS deficiency -- N-acetylglutamate synthase ORNT1 deficiency -- Ornithine translocase OTC deficiency -- Ornithine transcarbamylase Parents pass these diseases down to their children through defective genes. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child's body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome, and they mostly pass it to their sons. UCDs fall into two groups: Complete UCD: This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You'll notice symptoms in the first couple of days: Fussy Sleepy or sluggish Can't feed Vomits Low body temperature Problems with posture Seizures Fast breathing that becomes slow Coma Partial UCD: Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as he needs. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years. A buildup of ammonia (you may hear the doctor call it hyperammonemia) can happen from illness, injury, stress, or quick weight loss. Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include: Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Behavior problems, including hyperactivity Mental problems (confusion, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis) Most newborns in the U. S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies. If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam. They'll ask about your family history and do tests. They'll look for ammonia in your child's blood and amino acid in his blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of his liver through a process called biopsy. They'll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis. UCDs are life-threatening. Don't wait to get treatment. A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time: Dialysis to remove ammonia from his blood Feeding him supplements of sugars, fats, and amino acids Medicines to remove extra nitrogen Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout his life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on his body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause his levels to rise. During those times, you'll need to give him extra calories so his body has plenty of fuel. Long-term treatment will include: A low protein, high-calorie diet Medications to remove nitrogen Supplements of amino acids Drinking plenty of water A liver transplant can reverse the symptoms of a urea cycle disorder. There's no cure for UCDs. Your child's long-term health depends on which UCD he has, how severe it is, how early it was diagnosed, and how closely you follow the treatment plan.

They stop abnormal electrical signals that move through your heart and cause an irregular heartbeat (the doctor might call it arrhythmia). Cardiac ablation can also treat atrial fibrillation ( AFib), also a type of irregular heartbeat. The doctor may try cardiac ablation if medications and resetting your heartbeat -- he'll probably refer to it as cardioversion -- don't work. Catheter ablation, also called radiofrequency or pulmonary vein ablation, isn't surgery, and it's the least invasive option. Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into a blood vessel in your leg or neck. Then, it's guided to your heart. When it reaches the area that's causing the arrhythmia, It sends out electrical signals that destroy those cells. The treated tissue helps get your heartbeat regular again. There are two main types: Radiofrequency ablation: The doctor uses catheters to send radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) that creates circular scars around each vein or group of veins. Cryoablation: A single catheter sends a balloon tipped with a substance that freezes the tissues to cause a scar. Surgical ablation involves cutting into your chest. There are three kinds: Maze procedure: This is usually done while you're having open-heart surgery for another problem, like a bypass or valve replacement. The surgeon makes small cuts in the upper part of the heart. They're stitched together to form the scar tissue that stops abnormal signals. Mini maze: Most people with AFib don't need open-heart surgery. That's where this less invasive option comes in. The doctor makes several small cuts between your ribs and uses a camera to guide catheters for either cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation. Some hospitals offer robotic-assisted surgery that uses smaller cuts and makes the procedure more precise. Your doctor will put a video camera or tiny robot into your chest. It'll guide the creation of scar tissue that may help keep your heartbeat at the right pace. Convergent procedure: This pairs catheter ablation with a mini maze. The doctor uses radiofrequency ablation in the pulmonary vein, and a surgeon makes a small cut under your breastbone to use radiofrequency energy on the outside of your heart. You and your doctor will talk about AFib treatment options, including ablation. The plan will depend on: The cause of your AFib Whether you have symptoms Your chance of having heart disease Different types of ablation target different parts of your heart. You may be able to go home the same day, or you may need to stay a night or longer in the hospital. Drugs can treat the AFib and keep your heart at a regular rhythm, but they may cause side effects or stop working. Cardiac ablation might be the next option. It can provide a treatment that lasts longer or cures the AFib. Nonsurgical and less invasive ablation are successful for many people with AFib. If the first procedure is not successful, often a second will be. With those options, you'll be able to recover and get back to your normal routine quickly. More than likely you'll need to: Stop eating or drinking the night before the procedure. Stop taking medications to treat arrhythmia several days before. Ask the doctor if you should stop any other medications. Ask the doctor about precautions if you have a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator. The doctor will provide any other special instructions. If you don't treat AFib, your odds of getting blood clots, heart failure, or stroke go up. These could be life-threatening. The doctor will take your risk factors into account before he suggests a treatment. If you have no symptoms, or they're mild, he may watch and wait. But he might prescribe warfarin or another blood thinner to protect you from strokes. Cardiac ablation may be right for you if AFib symptoms are more severe and make it hard to do daily tasks It depends on what type of procedure you have: Catheter ablation: You may need to spend a night in the hospital, but most people go home the same day. If so, you'll rest in a recovery room for a few hours while a nurse closely watches your heart rate and blood pressure. You need to lie flat and still to prevent bleeding from where your skin was cut. Plan to have someone drive you. The doctor will prescribe a medication to prevent blood clots and another to prevent AFib. You'll probably take them for 2 months. A shower is OK once you're home, but keep the water on the cooler side. Don't take a bath, swim, or soak for 5 days or until the cuts have healed. For the first week: Don't lift more than 10 pounds. Skip activities that make you push or pull heavy things -- don't shovel show or mow the lawn. If you get tired, stop and rest. Don't exercise -- you can go back to normal in week two. Maze procedure: You'll probably be in the hospital about a week. You'll spend the first couple of days in an intensive care unit ( ICU), then move to a regular room before you go home. Full recovery takes about 6-8 weeks, but you should be able to return to normal activities within 2-3 weeks. You should start to feel better in about 4 weeks. You'll probably take a blood thinner for about 3 months. Mini maze: You'll be in the ICU for a few hours to a day. You'll probably stay for 2-4 days total. Open-heart maze: This is major surgery. You'll spend a day or two in intensive care, and you may be in the hospital up to a week. At first, you'll feel very tired and have some chest pain. You can probably go back to work in about 3 months, but it may take 6 months to get back to normal. Once you're home: You may need someone to drive you for a while -- the doctor will tell you when you can drive again. You'll probably need help at home. You'll need to go back in about 10 days to get stitches out. Don't lift anything heavy for several weeks. Convergent procedure: Usually requires a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. Recovery is similar to catheter ablation. Any procedure has risks. Problems with cardiac ablation can include: Bleeding or infection where the catheter went in Damaged blood vessels if the catheter scrapes them on its way through Arrhythmias caused by damage to your heart's electrical system Blood clots in your legs or lungs Heart damage, like punctures or damaged valves Stroke or heart attack Narrowing of the veins between your lungs and heart Kidney damage from the dye Radiation Death Catheter ablation may not cure your AFib, but it will often relieve your symptoms. You could still have AFib episodes during the first 3 months, because that's how long it takes for the scars to form. If you've had AFib a long time, you'll likely need a repeat treatment to keep your heartbeat normal. You may also need medicine to control your heart rhythm for a few months after the procedure. Most people who have the maze procedure get long-term relief from their symptoms. And many don't need to take heart rhythm medicine afterward.", "question": "How effective is cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?", "answer": ["Nonsurgical and less invasive ablation are successful for many people with AFib.

They stop abnormal electrical signals that move through your heart and cause an irregular heartbeat (the doctor might call it arrhythmia). Cardiac ablation can also treat atrial fibrillation ( AFib), also a type of irregular heartbeat. The doctor may try cardiac ablation if medications and resetting your heartbeat -- he'll probably refer to it as cardioversion -- don't work. Catheter ablation, also called radiofrequency or pulmonary vein ablation, isn't surgery, and it's the least invasive option. Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into a blood vessel in your leg or neck. Then, it's guided to your heart. When it reaches the area that's causing the arrhythmia, It sends out electrical signals that destroy those cells. The treated tissue helps get your heartbeat regular again. There are two main types: Radiofrequency ablation: The doctor uses catheters to send radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) that creates circular scars around each vein or group of veins. Cryoablation: A single catheter sends a balloon tipped with a substance that freezes the tissues to cause a scar. Surgical ablation involves cutting into your chest. There are three kinds: Maze procedure: This is usually done while you're having open-heart surgery for another problem, like a bypass or valve replacement. The surgeon makes small cuts in the upper part of the heart. They're stitched together to form the scar tissue that stops abnormal signals. Mini maze: Most people with AFib don't need open-heart surgery. That's where this less invasive option comes in. The doctor makes several small cuts between your ribs and uses a camera to guide catheters for either cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation. Some hospitals offer robotic-assisted surgery that uses smaller cuts and makes the procedure more precise. Your doctor will put a video camera or tiny robot into your chest. It'll guide the creation of scar tissue that may help keep your heartbeat at the right pace. Convergent procedure: This pairs catheter ablation with a mini maze. The doctor uses radiofrequency ablation in the pulmonary vein, and a surgeon makes a small cut under your breastbone to use radiofrequency energy on the outside of your heart. You and your doctor will talk about AFib treatment options, including ablation. The plan will depend on: The cause of your AFib Whether you have symptoms Your chance of having heart disease Different types of ablation target different parts of your heart. You may be able to go home the same day, or you may need to stay a night or longer in the hospital. Drugs can treat the AFib and keep your heart at a regular rhythm, but they may cause side effects or stop working. Cardiac ablation might be the next option. It can provide a treatment that lasts longer or cures the AFib. Nonsurgical and less invasive ablation are successful for many people with AFib. If the first procedure is not successful, often a second will be. With those options, you'll be able to recover and get back to your normal routine quickly. More than likely you'll need to: Stop eating or drinking the night before the procedure. Stop taking medications to treat arrhythmia several days before. Ask the doctor if you should stop any other medications. Ask the doctor about precautions if you have a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator. The doctor will provide any other special instructions. If you don't treat AFib, your odds of getting blood clots, heart failure, or stroke go up. These could be life-threatening. The doctor will take your risk factors into account before he suggests a treatment. If you have no symptoms, or they're mild, he may watch and wait. But he might prescribe warfarin or another blood thinner to protect you from strokes. Cardiac ablation may be right for you if AFib symptoms are more severe and make it hard to do daily tasks It depends on what type of procedure you have: Catheter ablation: You may need to spend a night in the hospital, but most people go home the same day. If so, you'll rest in a recovery room for a few hours while a nurse closely watches your heart rate and blood pressure. You need to lie flat and still to prevent bleeding from where your skin was cut. Plan to have someone drive you. The doctor will prescribe a medication to prevent blood clots and another to prevent AFib. You'll probably take them for 2 months. A shower is OK once you're home, but keep the water on the cooler side. Don't take a bath, swim, or soak for 5 days or until the cuts have healed. For the first week: Don't lift more than 10 pounds. Skip activities that make you push or pull heavy things -- don't shovel show or mow the lawn. If you get tired, stop and rest. Don't exercise -- you can go back to normal in week two. Maze procedure: You'll probably be in the hospital about a week. You'll spend the first couple of days in an intensive care unit ( ICU), then move to a regular room before you go home. Full recovery takes about 6-8 weeks, but you should be able to return to normal activities within 2-3 weeks. You should start to feel better in about 4 weeks. You'll probably take a blood thinner for about 3 months. Mini maze: You'll be in the ICU for a few hours to a day. You'll probably stay for 2-4 days total. Open-heart maze: This is major surgery. You'll spend a day or two in intensive care, and you may be in the hospital up to a week. At first, you'll feel very tired and have some chest pain. You can probably go back to work in about 3 months, but it may take 6 months to get back to normal. Once you're home: You may need someone to drive you for a while -- the doctor will tell you when you can drive again. You'll probably need help at home.

These include medications to help ease pain and inflammation and surgeries to help you move better. Your goal is to manage your AS so you can live an active life. Your first step to treat AS will be to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs). They help relieve your inflammation, pain, stiffness, and swelling. Still, NSAIDs do not treat the problems with your immune system when you have AS. These problems cause damage to your joints and bones. NSAIDs used to treat AS pain and stiffness include: Celecoxib ( Celebrex) Diclofenac Ibuprofen Indomethacin Meloxicam ( Mobic) Naproxen You can get most NSAIDs in generic forms. Some, like ibuprofen and naproxen, are sold over the counter in drugstores. Unfortunately, NSAIDs can break down the barriers that protect your stomach. This can cause an upset stomach and heartburn. In time, NSAIDs can cause ulcers even if you don't have symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine to protect your stomach. Celecoxib is an NSAID that may ease inflammation without hurting your stomach. If NSAIDs don't ease your AS symptoms, your doctor may prescribe stronger drugs called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs). They affect your immune system and can help curb inflammation. They may help with the arthritis that can damage your back and other joints. They also may ease symptoms like joint pain and swelling. DMARDs don't work very well for inflammation in the spine. DMARDs used to treat AS include: Methotrexate Sulfasalazine ( Azulfidine) Methotrexate comes in both pills and shots you can give yourself at home. You may take folic acid supplements to help ease side effects like mouth sores or nausea. Methotrexate can affect your liver, so your doctor will test your blood to make sure your liver is healthy. Sulfasalazine is available as pills. You may have side effects like headaches, bloating, nausea, or mouth ulcers. Your doctor will test your blood from time to time to watch for side effects. If you have severe inflammation in a joint (called a flare), your doctor may give you a shot of corticosteroid in that spot. These drugs are also called steroids. A steroid shot may give you short-term relief from pain and swelling in your joint. Your doctor can inject steroids into the joints, including your sacroiliac (where your lower back meets your pelvis), knee, or hip joint. While these can help, you don't want to rely on them as your main treatment. If NSAIDs or DMARDs don't control your AS, your doctor may prescribe drugs called biologics. These drugs aim to fix the problems with your immune system. They target your body's production of specific proteins that cause inflammation. Biologic drugs affect your immune system and can help ease AS symptoms (pain, swelling, tenderness, and stiffness) as well as inflammation. These drugs may also help protect your joints from damage. You have a higher chance of getting infections like tuberculosis when you take biologics. If you have signs of an infection, such as a fever or congestion, you should tell your doctor. Your doctor will test you for tuberculosis before you start a biologic drug and while you take it. These drugs also may raise your odds of getting certain types of cancer, but this is rare. Biologic drugs used to treat AS include: Adalimumab ( Humira) Certolizumab ( Cimzia) Etanercept ( Enbrel) Golimumab ( Simponi) Infliximab ( Remicade) Secukinumab ( Cosentyx) There is research going on now to find new treatments for AS. Some studies focus on genes, including HLA- B27, that make you more likely to get the disease. Others focus on proteins that may trigger inflammation.

Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it's not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix).

Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood. Limiting how much sodium you eat can also help.", "question": "How does an edema happen?", "answer": ["Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues.

This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema.

If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood.

Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema.

Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood. Limiting how much sodium you eat can also help.", "question": "How do you know if your edema is caused by liver disease?", "answer": ["Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid.

Imagine a piece of silk. Just one small tear can make a big difference in how it looks. And it's the same with skin. Any burn, injury, or other trauma, such as surgery, can cause a scar. Now a scar isn't bad if it's small or in a location that's easy to conceal. But when it's not, you may wonder if there's a way to treat it, other than hiding it under your clothes, that will make it go away or at least change how it looks. The truth is the scar will never completely go away. But there are some methods that can help reduce its size and change its appearance. Scarring is a natural part of the healing process after an injury. Its appearance and its treatment depend on multiple factors. The depth and size of the wound or cut and the location of the injury matter. So do your age, genes, sex, and ethnicity. These are several different types of scars including: Keloid scars. These scars are the result of an overly aggressive healing process. They extend beyond the original injury. Over time, a keloid scar may hamper movement. Treatments include surgery to remove the scar, steroid injections, or silicone sheets to flatten the scar. Smaller keloids can be treated using cryotherapy (freezing therapy using liquid nitrogen). You can also prevent keloid formation by using pressure treatment or gel pads with silicone when you are injured. Keloid scars are most common among people with dark skin. Contracture scars. If your skin has been burned, you may have a contracture scar. These scars tighten skin, which can impair your ability to move. Contracture scars may also go deeper, affecting muscles and nerves. Hypertrophic scars. These are raised, red scars that are similar to keloids but do not go beyond the boundary of the injury. Treatments include injections of steroids to reduce inflammation or silicone sheets, which flatten the scar. Acne scars. If you've had severe acne, you probably have the scars to prove it. There are many types of acne scars, ranging from deep pits to scars that are angular or wavelike in appearance. Treatment options depend on the types of acne scars you have. Scar treatments may include: Over-the-counter or prescription creams, ointments, or gels. These products can be used to treat scars that are caused by cuts or other injuries or wounds. If you are under the care of a plastic surgeon and your scarring is from cosmetic or plastic surgery, ask your surgeon if over-the-counter treatment is an option. If not, there are prescriptions that may help. Often, treatments can include steroids or certain oral antihistamines for scars that cause itching and are very sensitive. Likewise, if you have scarring from severe acne, ask your dermatologist for advice. Your doctor can also recommend or use pressure treatment or silicone gel sheeting to help treat scars or as preventive care. Surgical removal or treatment. There are many options to treat deeper scars depending on your particular case. These include skin grafts, excision, dermabrasion, or laser surgery. In a skin graft, the surgeon uses skin from another area of your body. This is often used with people who've had burns. If you've got scarring that impairs function, surgery can help address the functional problems. If you've recently had surgery that has caused scars, it is best to wait at least one year before making a decision about scar treatment. Many scars fade and become less noticeable over time. Injections. You may get steroid injections to treat scars that stick out, such as keloids or hypertrophic scars. Your doctor may use this on its own or with other treatments. Other types of injections, such as collagen or other \"fillers,\" may be useful for some types of pitted scarring, although these are not usually permanent solutions. If your scar physically impairs you in any way, you may be able to get coverage from your health insurer. Ask your doctor to write a letter detailing your particular case. Your doctor can also take photos to support your case. If you are undergoing scar treatment for cosmetic purposes, you will most likely have to pay for it all yourself.

Though most MRSA infections aren't serious, some can be life-threatening. Many public health experts are alarmed by the spread of tough strains of MRSA. Because it's hard to treat, MRSA is sometimes called a \"super bug.\" Garden-variety staph are common bacteria that can live in our bodies. Plenty of healthy people carry staph without being infected by it. In fact, one third of everybody has staph bacteria in their noses. But staph can be a problem if it manages to get into the body, often through a cut. Once there, it can cause an infection. Staph is one of the most common causes of skin infections in the U. S. Usually, these are minor and don't need special treatment. Less often, staph can cause serious problems like infected wounds or pneumonia. Staph can usually be treated with antibiotics. But over the decades, some strains of staph -- like MRSA -- have become resistant to antibiotics that once destroyed it. MRSA was first discovered in 1961. It's now resistant to methicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, oxacillin, and other common antibiotics known as cephalosporins. While some antibiotics still work, MRSA is constantly adapting. Researchers developing new antibiotics are having a tough time keeping up. MRSA is spread by contact. So, you could get MRSA by touching another person who has it on the skin. Or you could get it by touching objects that have the bacteria on them. MRSA is carried by about 2% of the population (or 2 in 100 people), although most of them aren't infected. There are two different populations of people who get MRSA -- one is in decline -- those who get it in hospitals or other health care environments -- and the other is on the rise -- those who get it in the community. MRSA infections are common among people who have weak immune systems who are in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care centers. Infections can appear around surgical wounds or invasive devices, like catheters or implanted feeding tubes. According to the CDC, invasive MRSA infections that began in hospitals declined 8% between 2011 and 2013. Community- Associated MRSA ( CA- MRSA) Alarmingly, MRSA is also showing up in healthy people who have not been hospitalized. This type of MRSA is called community-associated MRSA, or CA- MRSA.

Farmers are most likely to get it because it's usually caused by breathing in dust from hay, corn, grass for animal feed, grain, tobacco, or some pesticides. Not everyone gets farmer's lung after breathing in these things. It only happens if you have an allergic reaction. Your doctor may use another name for your condition. It's also called extrinsic allergic alveolitis, hypersensitivity alveolitis, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The \"-itis\" at the end of these names means it causes inflammation. With farmer's lung, the inflammation, or swelling, is in your lungs. Farmer's lung can cause three kinds of allergic reactions. An acute attack is an intense reaction that happens 4 to 8 hours after you breathe in mold. Symptoms include: Dry irritating cough Fever and chills Rapid breathing Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Sudden feeling that you're sick A sub-acute attack is less intense and comes on more slowly than an acute attack. Symptoms include: Achy muscles and joints Coughing Mild fever with some chills No appetite Shortness of breath Weight loss You may mistake acute or sub-acute farmer's lung for the flu, because many of the symptoms are the same. Chronic farmer's lung happens after you've had many acute attacks and are around large amounts of moldy dust often. When you reach this point, your lungs may have permanent damage. Symptoms include: Cough that won't go away Depression General aches and pains Night sweats No appetite and gradual weight loss Occasional fever Shortness of breath that gets worse over time Weakness and loss of energy Most people with acute or subacute farmer's lung get better; only a small percentage of people develop chronic farmer's lung. Farmers may notice that their symptoms get worse in the winter. Storing animal feed like hay, grass, or grain inside makes mold more likely to grow. Plus, there's no breeze or wind to clear it out of the air. It's common for farmers to get this disease from moldy hay and other crops. But you also can get it from dust in things like: Animal dander Bacteria Bark Bird droppings Dried rat urine Feathers Fungi Husks Insects Wood These allergens have to be very small -- around 5 millionths of a meter (5 microns) -- to affect you. Because the particles are so tiny, the normal defenses in your nose and throat miss them, and they go straight to your lungs. Your lungs then try to get rid of the dust, and your symptoms start when your immune system reacts to that. The most important questions your doctor will ask you will be about your environment. If you're not a farmer, it may be harder to figure out that farmer's lung is causing your symptoms. It can also be hard to know what's going on if you're not having an acute attack. Your doctor can give you a blood test to look for certain things that trigger your immune system (called antigens) or order a chest X-ray to look for signs that you've had acute attacks. Other things your doctor can do to find out if you have farmer's lung include: Pulmonary function test: This measures how much air you inhale and exhale. Bronchoscopy: Your doctor uses a device called a bronchoscope to look at your airways and lungs and collect a sample of fluid for testing. You'll be given medicine to make you sleep through this. Lung biopsy: If your doctor thinks you might have farmer's lung but can't be sure, he may want to take a sample of your lung tissue and send it to a lab for tests. You'll probably be given medicine to sleep through this as well. There's no cure for farmer's lung, but you can control it by staying away from the allergen that causes your symptoms. You might: Work outside as much as possible Avoid dusty work Wear a mask or other protective equipment Use fans, filters, or exhaust blowers wherever you can Steroid drugs like prednisone ( Deltasone, Orasone, Meticorten) can help with your symptoms because they can slow down your immune system and help with inflammation. Your doctor may only prescribe these if you have a chronic case, though. If steroids don't work, your doctor may want to prescribe and immune suppressant such as a drug called azathrioprine ( Azasan).

With farmer's lung, the inflammation, or swelling, is in your lungs. Farmer's lung can cause three kinds of allergic reactions. An acute attack is an intense reaction that happens 4 to 8 hours after you breathe in mold. Symptoms include: Dry irritating cough Fever and chills Rapid breathing Rapid heart rate Shortness of breath Sudden feeling that you're sick A sub-acute attack is less intense and comes on more slowly than an acute attack.

But what does it mean if it's green? What about red, yellow, white, and black? Most of the time, minor changes in the color of your waste are due to diet. After all, we don't eat the same thing at every meal, every day. But sometimes a color change can signal a minor health issue. In rare cases, it means something serious is wrong in your digestive system. If the color you see before you flush worries you, call your doctor. Poop is normally brown. The color is the result of what you eat and how much bile is in your stool. Bile is a fluid your liver makes to digest fats. It starts out as a yellowish green color. But as the pigments that give bile its color travel through your digestive system, they go through chemical changes and turn brown. Most of the time, green or greenish poop is normal. Some of the things that can cause it: Green veggies, like spinach or kale Green food coloring, such as in drink mixes or ice pops Iron supplements If you have green diarrhea, the color of your food may not be to blame. It's likely that your meal moved through your gut too quickly, so the fat-digesting bile didn't have time to turn brown. This shade is also normal for many people. It's common for babies, especially those who breastfeed. But if you have yellow poop that looks greasy and smells very bad, it may have too much fat. That could be a sign your body isn't digesting food properly. For example, if you have celiac disease, your body can't handle a protein called gluten, which is in wheat, barley, and rye. If you have the condition and eat foods that have gluten, like many breads, pastas, and cookies, your intestines won't work as they should. There may be other causes of yellow poop that's greasy and smelly. If it happens to you often, tell your doctor. Medicines for diarrhea like bismuth subsalicylate ( Kaopectate, Pepto- Bismol) can sometimes cause pale or clay-colored poop. So can barium, a chalky liquid you drink before you get X-rays of the upper part of your digestive tract. A more serious cause is a lack of bile in your stool. ( Remember, bile gives poop its brown color.) Bile is made in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and released into your small intestine to help digest your food. If there's not enough of it to give your poop its typical brown color, it could be the sign of a problem along the way. Liver disease, such as hepatitis, can keep bile from getting into your body waste. So can a blockage in the tubes (called ducts) that carry bile. This can happen because of: Gallstones Tumor A condition you're born with called biliary atresia Babies' poop is black for the first few days after they're born. After that, it may be because you ate something very dark-colored or took a medicine or supplement that causes black poop. But this color can be a sign of a more serious problem: bleeding in the upper part of your digestive tract. Foods, medicines, and supplements that turn poop black include: Iron supplements Bismuth subsalicylate ( Kaopectate, Pepto- Bismol) Black licorice Blueberries Poop that looks like tar is often a sign of bleeding in the digestive tract. Some causes include: Ulcers Bleeding sores in your esophagus from acid reflux Noncancerous tumors Cancer If you don't think black poop came from what you ate, you need to talk to your doctor. If you see red or reddish poop in the toilet, don't be alarmed right away. First ask yourself if you've had red foods lately. Beets, Jell- O, tomato soup, and red drinks can change the color of your stool. If you don't think your diet is the cause, the red you see may be blood. And if it's bright red, the blood likely comes from the lower part of your digestive tract. Common causes include: Noncancerous tumors Cancer Inflammation in the colon, called colitis Growths called polyps in your colon Conditions caused by small sacs in the wall of the colon, called diverticular disease Hemorrhoids Call your doctor if you see red that's probably not from food you ate.", "question": "What does yellow poop mean?", "answer": ["This shade is also normal for many people.

It's more common in men than women, and more in whites than African- Americans. There's really nothing you can do to prevent leukemia. It's cancer of your blood cells caused by a rise in the number of white blood cells in your body. They crowd out the red blood cells and platelets your body needs to be healthy. All those extra white blood cells don't work right, and that causes problems. Blood has three types of cells: white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen, and platelets that help blood to clot. Every day, billions of new blood cells are made in the bone marrow -- most of them red cells. But when you have leukemia, your body makes more white cells than it needs. There are two main types of white blood cells in your body: lymphoid cells and myeloid cells. Leukemia can happen in either type. These leukemia cells can't fight infection the way normal white blood cells do. And because there are so many of them, they start to affect the way your major organs work. Eventually, there aren't enough red blood cells to supply oxygen, enough platelets to clot the blood, or enough normal white blood cells to fight infection. Along with infection, this can cause problems like anemia, bruising, and bleeding. Leukemia is grouped in two ways: How fast it develops and gets worse Which type of blood cell is involved (usually myeloid or lymphoid) These types are then put into one of two categories: acute or chronic. Acute leukemia happens when most of the abnormal blood cells stay immature and can't carry out normal functions. It can get bad very fast. Chronic leukemia happens when there are some immature cells, but others are normal and can function normally. That means it gets bad, but more slowly. No one knows exactly what causes leukemia. People who have it have certain abnormal chromosomes, but the chromosomes don't cause the leukemia. You can't really prevent leukemia, but it may be possible that certain things in your environment could trigger the development of it. For example, if you are a tobacco smoker, you are more prone to some types of leukemia than a nonsmoker. It's also associated with a high amount of radiation exposure and certain chemicals. Some kinds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy used to treat other cancers can actually cause leukemia. The chance that you'll develop leukemia depends on the types of chemotherapy drugs used. Family history is another risk factor for leukemia. For example, if an identical twin gets a certain type of leukemia, there is a 20% chance the other twin will have it within a year. The treatment you get depends on the type of leukemia you have, how far it has spread, and how healthy you are. But the main options are: Chemotherapy Radiation Biologic therapy Targeted therapy Stem cell transplant Surgery Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells in your blood and bone marrow. You can get the medicine: Through an injection into a vein or muscle As a pill Into the fluid around your spinal cord Radiation uses high-energy X-rays to kill leukemia cells or keep them from growing. You can get it in only one part of your body where there are a lot of cancer cells, or all over. Biologic therapy, also called immunotherapy, helps your immune system find and attack cancer cells. Drugs like interleukins and interferon can help boost your body's natural defenses against leukemia. Targeted therapy uses drugs to block specific genes or proteins that cancer cells need to grow. This treatment can stop the signals leukemia cells use to grow and divide, cut off their blood supply, or kill them directly. Stem cell transplant replaces the leukemia cells in your bone marrow with new ones that make blood. Your doctor can get the new stem cells from your own body or from a donor. First you'll have high doses of chemotherapy to destroy the cancer cells in your bone marrow. Then you'll get the new stem cells through an infusion into one of your veins.

Eventually, there aren't enough red blood cells to supply oxygen, enough platelets to clot the blood, or enough normal white blood cells to fight infection. Along with infection, this can cause problems like anemia, bruising, and bleeding. Leukemia is grouped in two ways: How fast it develops and gets worse Which type of blood cell is involved (usually myeloid or lymphoid) These types are then put into one of two categories: acute or chronic. Acute leukemia happens when most of the abnormal blood cells stay immature and can't carry out normal functions. It can get bad very fast. Chronic leukemia happens when there are some immature cells, but others are normal and can function normally. That means it gets bad, but more slowly. No one knows exactly what causes leukemia. People who have it have certain abnormal chromosomes, but the chromosomes don't cause the leukemia. You can't really prevent leukemia, but it may be possible that certain things in your environment could trigger the development of it. For example, if you are a tobacco smoker, you are more prone to some types of leukemia than a nonsmoker. It's also associated with a high amount of radiation exposure and certain chemicals. Some kinds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy used to treat other cancers can actually cause leukemia. The chance that you'll develop leukemia depends on the types of chemotherapy drugs used. Family history is another risk factor for leukemia. For example, if an identical twin gets a certain type of leukemia, there is a 20% chance the other twin will have it within a year. The treatment you get depends on the type of leukemia you have, how far it has spread, and how healthy you are. But the main options are: Chemotherapy Radiation Biologic therapy Targeted therapy Stem cell transplant Surgery Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells in your blood and bone marrow. You can get the medicine: Through an injection into a vein or muscle As a pill Into the fluid around your spinal cord Radiation uses high-energy X-rays to kill leukemia cells or keep them from growing. You can get it in only one part of your body where there are a lot of cancer cells, or all over. Biologic therapy, also called immunotherapy, helps your immune system find and attack cancer cells. Drugs like interleukins and interferon can help boost your body's natural defenses against leukemia. Targeted therapy uses drugs to block specific genes or proteins that cancer cells need to grow. This treatment can stop the signals leukemia cells use to grow and divide, cut off their blood supply, or kill them directly. Stem cell transplant replaces the leukemia cells in your bone marrow with new ones that make blood. Your doctor can get the new stem cells from your own body or from a donor. First you'll have high doses of chemotherapy to destroy the cancer cells in your bone marrow. Then you'll get the new stem cells through an infusion into one of your veins. They will grow into new, healthy blood cells. Surgery. Your doctor can remove your spleen if it is filled with cancer cells and is pressing on nearby organs.

In targeted therapy, drugs go after changes in melanoma cells that make them grow out of control. This treatment tends to stop working well after a while. If that happens, you and your doctor will need to try another approach. Radiation. A specialist will zap the area with high-energy rays, which kill cancer cells. It's like getting an X-ray, but the dose is stronger. Clinical trials. Scientists are working on finding new treatments for melanoma. But they have to test them and compare how they work to current therapies before they become available for everyone. They do this in research studies called clinical trials. Your doctor might know if you can sign up for one. If you're accepted, you could get either a regular treatment that's already available or the one that scientists are testing. Your doctor might recommend more than one treatment at a time, like chemotherapy plus radiation. It depends on whether the cancer has spread and how far it has gone. Melanoma treatments might cause other kinds of health problems, including: Pain Scars Swelling in your arms or legs, called lymphedema. It happens when your body holds on to fluid because your lymph system is blocked or damaged. Infection Feeling tired Feeling sick to your stomach Constipation or diarrhea Anxiety or depression The side effects you have depend on the stage of your disease, how much treatment you get and how long it takes, and your general health. Some of them can last for a while after you finish treatment. Be sure to tell your doctor if you have any side effects, even if you think they're no big deal. There are almost always ways to control them so you'll feel better. Melanoma can come back after treatment. It can show up where it was before, or it can start on other places on your skin or in an organ inside your body like your liver. Your doctor will want to watch you closely for signs that the disease has returned, so it's important to keep your appointments for checkups. How often you have to see your doctor depends on what stage your melanoma was in when you were diagnosed. Usually it's every 6-12 months for disease in the early stages, and every 3-6 months for more advanced ones.", "question": "What are clinical trials for melanoma?", "answer": ["But they have to test them and compare how they work to current therapies before they become available for everyone.

What about your heart? Research shows that some of them may help lower cholesterol, improve blood pressure, and other things that put you at risk for heart disease. It's unclear, though, if they help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other problems. Here are six nutrients that can be a good addition to your heart-healthy lifestyle. Fiber. Found naturally in fruits, grains, vegetables, and legumes, fiber cuts down the amount of cholesterol your body soaks up from food. Try to get at least 25 to 30 grams of it every day. Men less than age 51 should aim for 38 grams a day. It's best to get your daily dose from your diet, but supplements are another option. There's good evidence that blond psyllium husk -- common in fiber supplements -- can lower âbadâ LDL cholesterol. It can also raise the âgoodâ kind, HDL. Other fiber supplements include methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil.. If you take a fiber supplement, increase the amount you take slowly. This can help prevent gas and cramping. It's also important to drink enough liquids when you increase your fiber intake. Sterols and stanols. Find these in foods like nuts and grains, or you can buy them as supplements. They reduce the amount of cholesterol that your body absorbs from food. They're also added to many foods, such as some margarines, orange juice, and yogurts. Experts recommend 2 grams a day to help lower LDL cholesterol for people who have high cholesterol. Coenzyme Q10 ( Co Q10 ). Your body naturally makes small amounts of this enzyme, also known as ubiquinone and ubiquinol. As a supplement, Co Q10 may help lower blood pressure, either on its own or along with medications. Other studies have found that adding it to heart failure drugs may help people feel better day to day. Co Q10 pills are also popular as a treatment for the side effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins. Why? These meds can sometimes lower the amount of Co Q10 the body makes on its own. Some doctors suggest adding a Co Q10 supplement to make up for the loss, hoping it will relieve problems like muscle pain and weakness. But study results have been mixed. Fish oil . Full of omega-3 fatty acids, it can slash levels of triglycerides -- an unhealthy fat in your blood -- by up to 30%. It may also improve blood pressure. But it's not clear if non-prescription fish oil supplements lower your risk of heart attack and stroke. Your best bet may be to eat fish with omega-3 fatty acids. The American Heart Association recommends that all adults eat at least two 3.5-ounce servings of fish a week. Garlic. Not only does it make just about anything taste delicious, it could also slightly lower blood pressure. It may slow the buildup of plaque in your arteries, lowering your risk of blood clots. Research shows that both garlic in food and in supplements may help. Green tea . Research shows that both the extract and the drink may lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and raise HDL levels. Don't take a supplement just because it's labeled \"heart healthy.\" Not all of them are guaranteed to help you, and it can be dangerous to get too much of some of them. Pay attention to what the supplement does, and make sure you really need it. Ask your doctor which product is most likely to help. If you have a heart condition or for a high risk for a heart attack, you must follow your doctor's advice. It's way too risky to try to treat a serious health condition on your own with over-the-counter supplements.", "question": "Are sterols and stanols good for heart health?", "answer": ["Find these in foods like nuts and grains, or you can buy them as supplements.

One procedure pulls the bladder (urethra) back up to a more normal position, relieving the pressure and leakage. Another surgery involves securing the bladder (urethra) with a \"sling,\" a piece of material that holds up the bladder to prevent leakage.

Surgery is reserved for severe cases. It aims to increase the amount of urine your bladder can store. For overflow incontinence, treatments include: Pads. Medication or surgery.

If you've had a baby, chances are you've been told to do Kegel exercises. These help to strengthen the pelvic floor after childbirth. They also help prevent stress incontinence. Best of all, you can do Kegels anytime, anywhere. Here's how: Squeeze the muscles that you use stop the flow of urine. Hold the squeeze for 10 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds. Do 3 or 4 sets daily. Note: You can learn how to do Kegels by stopping your urine, but don't do this routinely. Stopping the flow of urine can lead to an infection. Biofeedback . A probe is inserted to monitor when your bladder muscles squeeze. When you're able to recognize it as it's happening, you can start to gain control of it. It's often used in combination with Kegel exercises. Pessary. For women, doctors may prescribe a device called a pessary that is inserted into the vagina. It repositions the urethra to help reduce leakage. Injections and surgery. Shots to bulk up your urethral area may help. In more extreme cases, you may need surgery. One procedure pulls the bladder (urethra) back up to a more normal position, relieving the pressure and leakage. Another surgery involves securing the bladder (urethra) with a \"sling,\" a piece of material that holds up the bladder to prevent leakage. For urge incontinence, treatment options include: Timed voiding and bladder training. First, you complete a chart of the times you pee and the times you leak. You observe patterns and then plan to empty your bladder before an accident would happen. You can also \"retrain\" your bladder, gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits. Kegel exercises are also helpful. Medications, electrical stimulation, or surgery. Doctors sometimes prescribe medicines (or inject Botox in the bladder) that block the contractions of an overactive bladder. Electrical stimulation of the bladder nerves helps in some cases. Surgery is reserved for severe cases. It aims to increase the amount of urine your bladder can store. For overflow incontinence, treatments include: Pads. Medication or surgery. Meds called alpha-blockers often can help if the problem is caused by an enlarged prostate. If there's a blockage, you may need surgery. Catheter. Some people use a catheter to make sure their bladder is emptied. It's a thin plastic tube that you insert in your urethra. A doctor or nurse can teach you how to insert it for yourself. It's important to identify any underlying disease or blockage causing overflow incontinence and treat that. You might feel embarrassed to talk about your urinary incontinence, but it's worth it. Your doctor can help you figure out what's causing your problem. That's the first step to getting help. Be straightforward. Just tell your doctor you're having problems.

There are several different types, causes, and treatments. With this type, urine leaks due to weakened pelvic floor muscles and tissues. It can happen when pressure on your bladder increases -- such as when you exercise, laugh, sneeze, or cough. Pregnancy and childbirth can stretch and weaken a woman's pelvic floor muscles. Other things that can lead to stress incontinence are being overweight or obese, taking certain medications or, in men, having prostate surgery. This is also called overactive bladder ( OAB). With this type, you have an urgent need to go to the bathroom and may not get there in time. Causes of overactive bladder include: Damage to the bladder's nerves Damage to other parts of the nervous system Damage to muscles Aging Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and stroke can affect nerves, leading to urge incontinence. Bladder problems, such as infections and bladder stones, and certain medications can also cause it. If you can't empty your bladder, you may have overflow incontinence. This means you may dribble urine. Causes include: Weak bladder muscles Nerve damage Conditions that block the flow of urine, such as tumors or an enlarged prostate Constipation Certain medications You need to get the condition treated. If your bladder can't empty, that can lead to infections and other problems. Mental or physical problems such as dementia or arthritis prevent you from getting to the bathroom in time.

Oral glucose tolerance test. After fasting for 8 hours, you get a special sugary drink. Two hours later your sugar level is higher than 200. Random check. The doctor tests your blood sugar and it's higher than 200, plus you're peeing more, always thirsty, and you've gained or lost a significant amount of weight. He'll then do a fasting sugar level test or an oral glucose tolerance test to confirm the diagnosis. Any sugar levels higher than normal are unhealthy. Levels that are higher than normal, but not reaching the point of full-blown diabetes, are called prediabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, 86 million people in the U. S. have this condition, which can lead to diabetes if you don't make healthy lifestyle changes that your doctor recommends. It also raises the risk for heart disease, although not as much as diabetes does. It's possible to keep prediabetes from becoming diabetes with diet and exercise. Why are high blood sugar levels bad for you? Glucose is precious fuel for all the cells in your body when it's present at normal levels. But it can behave like a slow-acting poison. High sugar levels slowly erode the ability of cells in your pancreas to make insulin. The organ overcompensates and insulin levels stay too high. Over time, the pancreas is permanently damaged. High levels of blood sugar can cause changes that lead to a hardening of the blood vessels, what doctors call atherosclerosis. Almost any part of your body can be harmed by too much sugar. Damaged blood vessels cause problems such as: Kidney disease or kidney failure, requiring dialysis Strokes Heart attacks Vision loss or blindness Weakened immune system, with a greater risk of infections Erectile dysfunction Nerve damage, also called neuropathy, that causes tingling, pain, or less sensation in your feet, legs, and hands Poor circulation to the legs and feet Slow wound-healing and the potential for amputation in rare cases Keep your blood sugar levels close to normal to avoid many of these complications.

What should you expect? Everyone's case is different, but here's a rough outline of what will happen after hip replacement surgery -- from the day of the operation to three months later. Day of Your Hip Replacement Surgery You'll check in several hours before your scheduled surgery. Expect to stay for 3 to 4 days. The procedure will probably last about 2 to 3 hours. Recovery from anesthesia will probably take about 2 hours. Once you're fully awake, you'll go to your hospital room. You will likely stick to a liquid diet for the rest of the day. You will need medication to help with pain and to prevent infection and blood clots. 1 to 2 Days After Hip Replacement Surgery You'll get out of bed -- with assistance -- and start moving around using a walker or crutches.

{"id": "027a239056f2a7e21174dba58347dfbd", "url": "https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/qa/what-are-situational-phobias", "subject": "", "topic": "", "context": "The term \"phobia\" refers to a group of anxiety symptoms brought on by certain objects or situations. A specific phobia, formerly called a simple phobia, is a lasting and unreasonable fear caused by the presence or thought of a specific object or situation that usually poses little or no actual danger. Exposure to the object or situation brings about an immediate reaction, causing the person to endure intense anxiety (nervousness) or to avoid the object or situation entirely. The distress associated with the phobia and/or the need to avoid the object or situation can significantly interfere with the person's ability to function. Adults with a specific phobia recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable, yet are unable to overcome it. There are different types of specific phobias, based on the object or situation feared, including: Animal phobias: Examples include the fear of dogs, snakes, insects, or mice. Animal phobias are the most common specific phobias. Situational phobias: These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator. Natural environment phobias: Examples include the fear of storms, heights, or water. Blood-injection-injury phobias: These involve a fear of being injured, of seeing blood or of invasive medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections Other phobias: These include a fear of falling down, a fear of loud sounds, and a fear of costumed characters, such as clowns. A person can have more than one specific phobia. Symptoms of specific phobias may include: Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart, nausea or diarrhea, sweating, trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking Anticipatory anxiety, which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia; for example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because he or she may see a dog along the way. Children with a specific phobia may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that about 5%-12% of Americans have phobias. Specific phobias affect an estimated 6.3 million adult Americans. Phobias usually first appear in adolescence and adulthood, but can occur in people of all ages. They are slightly more common in women than in men. Specific phobias in children are common and usually disappear over time. Specific phobias in adults generally start suddenly and are more lasting than childhood phobias. Only about 20% of specific phobias in adults go away on their own (without treatment). The exact cause of specific phobias is not known, but most appear to be associated with a traumatic experience or a learned reaction. For example, a person who has a frightening or threatening experience with an animal, such as an attack or being bitten, can develop a specific phobia. Witnessing a traumatic event in which others experience harm or extreme fear can also cause a specific phobia, as can receiving information or repeated warnings about potentially dangerous situations or animals. Fear can be learned from others, as well. A child whose parents react with fear and anxiety to certain objects or situations is likely to also respond to those objects with fear. If symptoms of a specific phobia are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a medical and psychiatric history and may perform a brief physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose specific phobias, the doctor may use various tests to make sure that a physical illness isn't the cause of the symptoms. If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use clinical interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a specific phobia. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis of specific phobias on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. A specific phobia is diagnosed if the person's fear and anxiety are particularly distressing or if they interfere with his or her daily routine, including school, work, social activities, and relationships. Treatment for specific phobias may include one or a combination of: Cognitive behavioral therapy : Psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for specific phobias. Treatment usually involves a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called systematic desensitization or exposure and response prevention ( ERP) therapy, in which patients are gradually exposed to what frightens them until their fear begins to fade. Medication : For situational phobias that produce intense, temporary anxiety (for example, a fear of flying), short-acting sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) such as Ativan, or Xanax may be prescribed on an occasional, as-needed basis to help reduce anticipatory anxiety. Unless a phobia is accompanied by other conditions such as depression or panic disorder, long-term or daily medicines are generally not used. Occasionally, serotonergic antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac or Lexapromay have potential value for some patients.

A specific phobia, formerly called a simple phobia, is a lasting and unreasonable fear caused by the presence or thought of a specific object or situation that usually poses little or no actual danger. Exposure to the object or situation brings about an immediate reaction, causing the person to endure intense anxiety (nervousness) or to avoid the object or situation entirely. The distress associated with the phobia and/or the need to avoid the object or situation can significantly interfere with the person's ability to function. Adults with a specific phobia recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable, yet are unable to overcome it. There are different types of specific phobias, based on the object or situation feared, including: Animal phobias: Examples include the fear of dogs, snakes, insects, or mice. Animal phobias are the most common specific phobias. Situational phobias: These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator. Natural environment phobias: Examples include the fear of storms, heights, or water. Blood-injection-injury phobias: These involve a fear of being injured, of seeing blood or of invasive medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections Other phobias: These include a fear of falling down, a fear of loud sounds, and a fear of costumed characters, such as clowns. A person can have more than one specific phobia. Symptoms of specific phobias may include: Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart, nausea or diarrhea, sweating, trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking Anticipatory anxiety, which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia; for example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because he or she may see a dog along the way. Children with a specific phobia may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that about 5%-12% of Americans have phobias. Specific phobias affect an estimated 6.3 million adult Americans. Phobias usually first appear in adolescence and adulthood, but can occur in people of all ages. They are slightly more common in women than in men. Specific phobias in children are common and usually disappear over time. Specific phobias in adults generally start suddenly and are more lasting than childhood phobias. Only about 20% of specific phobias in adults go away on their own (without treatment). The exact cause of specific phobias is not known, but most appear to be associated with a traumatic experience or a learned reaction. For example, a person who has a frightening or threatening experience with an animal, such as an attack or being bitten, can develop a specific phobia. Witnessing a traumatic event in which others experience harm or extreme fear can also cause a specific phobia, as can receiving information or repeated warnings about potentially dangerous situations or animals. Fear can be learned from others, as well. A child whose parents react with fear and anxiety to certain objects or situations is likely to also respond to those objects with fear. If symptoms of a specific phobia are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a medical and psychiatric history and may perform a brief physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose specific phobias, the doctor may use various tests to make sure that a physical illness isn't the cause of the symptoms. If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use clinical interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a specific phobia. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis of specific phobias on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. A specific phobia is diagnosed if the person's fear and anxiety are particularly distressing or if they interfere with his or her daily routine, including school, work, social activities, and relationships. Treatment for specific phobias may include one or a combination of: Cognitive behavioral therapy : Psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for specific phobias. Treatment usually involves a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called systematic desensitization or exposure and response prevention ( ERP) therapy, in which patients are gradually exposed to what frightens them until their fear begins to fade. Medication : For situational phobias that produce intense, temporary anxiety (for example, a fear of flying), short-acting sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) such as Ativan, or Xanax may be prescribed on an occasional, as-needed basis to help reduce anticipatory anxiety. Unless a phobia is accompanied by other conditions such as depression or panic disorder, long-term or daily medicines are generally not used.

While genes and life stress may contribute to it, experts believe that symptoms may arise from a problem with nerve circuits and areas in the brain that control emotion, thinking, and behavior. The best treatment for bipolar disorder is often a combination of medication and counseling. Other treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) are often successful for people with very severe symptoms who don't respond to traditional therapy or who can't take the medications. Doctors sometimes treat the mania symptoms of bipolar disorder with one set of drugs and the depression symptoms with another, although some mood-stabilizing drugs are effective at treating both kinds of symptoms. Certain drugs are also used for \"maintenance\" to maintain a steady mood. Antidepressants are usually not used alone because they sometimes cause manic attacks in depressed patients, and they may be less effective for treating bipolar than unipolar depression. Many people respond well to medications for bipolar disorder. For many others, the symptoms do not completely disappear despite therapy. The mood symptoms may become less intense and more manageable, however. Remember, getting your diagnosis should come as a relief. Now you know what the problem has been and you're on the road to getting the right treatment. If you are suffering from bipolar mania, your doctor at first may treat you with an anti-manic mood stabilizer and sometimes also an antipsychotic drug and/or a benzodiazepine to quickly control hyperactivity, sleeplessness, hostility, and irritability. Mood stabilizers treat manias or depressions without causing symptoms to swing the other way. Some also may help to reduce the risk of suicide. They are usually taken for a long time, commonly for many years. Examples include lithium and certain anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine ( Tegretol), lamotrigine ( Lamictal) or valproate ( Depakote). Atypical antipsychotics used to treat mania include aripiprazole ( Abilify), asenapine ( Saphris), cariprazine ( Vryalar), olanzapine ( Zyprexa), quetiapine ( Seroquel), risperidone ( Risperdal), and ziprasidone ( Geodon) . Treating bipolar mania often requires hospitalization because there is high risk for unpredictable, reckless behavior and noncompliance with treatment. For people with extreme mania, pregnant women with mania, or those people whose mania can't be controlled with mood stabilizers, doctors sometimes also recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). If mania occurs while you are on maintenance therapy, your doctor may simply change your medication dose. Or you may start taking an antipsychotic drug or a second mood stabilizer to lessen symptoms. Also antidepressants should usually be discontinued while someone is manic, because they can worsen the symptoms of mania. Non-drug treatments, such as psychotherapy and establishing a well-ordered routine, may help patients in their maintenance phase. This is often suggested along with medication, but non-drug treatments are usually not effective alone. Treating bipolar depression is controversial and challenging. Studies have shown that antidepressants may be less effective in treating bipolar depression than they are in treating unipolar depression (that is, major depressive episodes in someone who has never had a previous manic or hypomanic episode). Also using antidepressants alone may trigger a manic or hypomanic episode in some people with bipolar disorder. Antidepressants alone also may lead to or prolong rapid cycling. In rapid cycling, a person may recover more quickly from depression but then experience mania followed by another episode of depression. And antidepressants can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts in children and adolescents with any form of depression. Three drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of bipolar depression: quetiapine ( Seroquel) by itself, olanzapine ( Zyprexa) when used with fluoxetine ( Prozac) (which also comes as a combination pill called Symbyax), and lurasidone ( Latuda) used alone or with lithium or valproate ( Depakote). The atypical antipsychotic drug caripirazine ( Vraylar) has also shown promise in initial studies to treat bipolar depression. There are also a number of treatments that have begun to show promise in research studies for treating bipolar depression, including the Parkinson's disease drug pramipexole dihydrochloride ( Mirapex), the wakefulness drugs modafinil ( Provigil) and armodinifinil ( Nuvigil), the nutritional supplement n-acetylcysteine, and the intravenous anesthetic drug ketamine. In April 2002, the American Psychiatric Association suggested using lithium or the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine ( Lamictal) as an initial treatment for people in the acute depressive phase of bipolar disorder who were not already taking a mood-stabilizing drug. Since then, research has shown that Lamictal seems to be more effective at preventing future depression rather than treating current depression in bipolar disorder. Recent studies have shown that Lamictal added to lithium may be a potent treatment for acute bipolar depression. For depressed bipolar patients who don't respond to mood stabilizers alone, or to FDA-approved medications for bipolar depression, doctors sometimes prescribe a mood stabilizer plus a traditional antidepressant -- often either buproprion ( Wellbutrin) or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) such as fluoxetine ( Prozac) or sertraline ( Zoloft), although the effectiveness of antidepressants has not been proven for bipolar depression. If all else fails, or if symptoms are especially severe, doctors may recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). It helps nearly 75% of the patients who are given this treatment. Two treatments called vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r TMS) are also being studied as a treatment for bipolar depression. In addition, psychotherapy may be beneficial when added to drug treatment. Once depression has resolved, mood stabilizers are the best-proven treatments to prevent either future depression or manias. If psychotic symptoms occur during an acute depressive episode, the doctor may recommend antipsychotic medicine.

If you are suffering from bipolar mania, your doctor at first may treat you with an anti-manic mood stabilizer and sometimes also an antipsychotic drug and/or a benzodiazepine to quickly control hyperactivity, sleeplessness, hostility, and irritability. Mood stabilizers treat manias or depressions without causing symptoms to swing the other way. Some also may help to reduce the risk of suicide. They are usually taken for a long time, commonly for many years. Examples include lithium and certain anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine ( Tegretol), lamotrigine ( Lamictal) or valproate ( Depakote). Atypical antipsychotics used to treat mania include aripiprazole ( Abilify), asenapine ( Saphris), cariprazine ( Vryalar), olanzapine ( Zyprexa), quetiapine ( Seroquel), risperidone ( Risperdal), and ziprasidone ( Geodon) . Treating bipolar mania often requires hospitalization because there is high risk for unpredictable, reckless behavior and noncompliance with treatment. For people with extreme mania, pregnant women with mania, or those people whose mania can't be controlled with mood stabilizers, doctors sometimes also recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). If mania occurs while you are on maintenance therapy, your doctor may simply change your medication dose. Or you may start taking an antipsychotic drug or a second mood stabilizer to lessen symptoms. Also antidepressants should usually be discontinued while someone is manic, because they can worsen the symptoms of mania. Non-drug treatments, such as psychotherapy and establishing a well-ordered routine, may help patients in their maintenance phase. This is often suggested along with medication, but non-drug treatments are usually not effective alone. Treating bipolar depression is controversial and challenging. Studies have shown that antidepressants may be less effective in treating bipolar depression than they are in treating unipolar depression (that is, major depressive episodes in someone who has never had a previous manic or hypomanic episode). Also using antidepressants alone may trigger a manic or hypomanic episode in some people with bipolar disorder. Antidepressants alone also may lead to or prolong rapid cycling. In rapid cycling, a person may recover more quickly from depression but then experience mania followed by another episode of depression. And antidepressants can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts in children and adolescents with any form of depression. Three drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of bipolar depression: quetiapine ( Seroquel) by itself, olanzapine ( Zyprexa) when used with fluoxetine ( Prozac) (which also comes as a combination pill called Symbyax), and lurasidone ( Latuda) used alone or with lithium or valproate ( Depakote). The atypical antipsychotic drug caripirazine ( Vraylar) has also shown promise in initial studies to treat bipolar depression. There are also a number of treatments that have begun to show promise in research studies for treating bipolar depression, including the Parkinson's disease drug pramipexole dihydrochloride ( Mirapex), the wakefulness drugs modafinil ( Provigil) and armodinifinil ( Nuvigil), the nutritional supplement n-acetylcysteine, and the intravenous anesthetic drug ketamine. In April 2002, the American Psychiatric Association suggested using lithium or the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine ( Lamictal) as an initial treatment for people in the acute depressive phase of bipolar disorder who were not already taking a mood-stabilizing drug. Since then, research has shown that Lamictal seems to be more effective at preventing future depression rather than treating current depression in bipolar disorder. Recent studies have shown that Lamictal added to lithium may be a potent treatment for acute bipolar depression. For depressed bipolar patients who don't respond to mood stabilizers alone, or to FDA-approved medications for bipolar depression, doctors sometimes prescribe a mood stabilizer plus a traditional antidepressant -- often either buproprion ( Wellbutrin) or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) such as fluoxetine ( Prozac) or sertraline ( Zoloft), although the effectiveness of antidepressants has not been proven for bipolar depression. If all else fails, or if symptoms are especially severe, doctors may recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). It helps nearly 75% of the patients who are given this treatment. Two treatments called vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r TMS) are also being studied as a treatment for bipolar depression. In addition, psychotherapy may be beneficial when added to drug treatment. Once depression has resolved, mood stabilizers are the best-proven treatments to prevent either future depression or manias.

That full range of motion lets you make different sounds when you speak. It also helps you swallow and sweep away bits of food to keep your mouth clean. But for babies with tongue-tie, there's a problem with something called the lingual frenulum. That's the small stretch of tissue that connects the underside of your tongue to the bottom of your mouth. It might be too short and tight, or attached way up near the tip of the tongue. Either way, it ties the tongue in place. For some, it's not much of an issue. For others, it can lead to problems breastfeeding. Later on, it can affect eating and speaking. Doctors don't always check for it, and it's not always easy to notice. But even if your child's pediatrician doesn't find it until later, it can be treated. Usually, the lingual frenulum separates from the tongue before your baby is born. But sometimes it doesn't. Doctors aren't sure why. It may run in families. We do know that boys are 3 times more likely to get it than girls. It's often found because of problems breastfeeding. You may notice your baby: Can't latch well Tends to chew more than suck Doesn't gain weight the way you'd expect Feeds for a long time, takes a short break, then feeds for another long stretch Is fussy when trying to feed Makes a clicking sound while feeding Seems hungry all the time Along with symptoms, you may hurt during and after breastfeeding. You may also have sore or cracked nipples. But tongue-tie isn't the only reason there may be breastfeeding problems. So if you're having them, talk to your doctor. You might also notice your baby's tongue: Can't move far from side to side Can't reach the upper gums or roof of the mouth Can't stick out past the gums Has a V shape or heart shape at its tip when it's sticking out A physical exam is all it takes to see what's going on. The doctor will: Ask how feeding is going Check your child's tongue, mouth, and teeth Use a tongue depressor, which is like a big popsicle stick, to look under your child's tongue and check the range of motion The doctor may ask older kids to move their tongue around and make certain sounds, like of an r or l. Not all doctors agree on this. Some say to take care of it right away to ward off any issues. Others think it's better to wait. That's because it might not cause any problems or may loosen up over time. There's no way to know for sure what'll happen.

Rolling an r can be especially hard. Talk it through with your doctor to learn what's best for you and your baby. There are two ways to take care of tongue-tie: Frenotomy: This basic procedure happens in a doctor's office. Sometimes you don't even need numbing drugs. The doctor takes a pair of specially cleaned scissors and clips the frenulum, which doesn't have many nerves or blood vessels. That means there's not much pain. And if there's any blood at all, it's a drop or two at most. Your baby can breastfeed right away, which can be soothing and healing. Frenuloplasty. When the frenulum is too thick for a quick snip, your pediatrician will choose this option. The doctor will: Give your child drugs so they sleep through the whole thing Use special tools to cut the frenulum Put in a few stitches that dissolve on their own as the wound heals Some hospitals may use a laser instead. In that case, your child won't need stitches. Both are usually very successful and prevent any speech, dental, or eating problems. It's rare for either one to cause any issues. As with any medical procedure though, there are risks, such as: Bleeding Damage to the tongue or the glands that make saliva Infection A frenuloplasty can also lead to scarring.

If you've got pain and swelling in your joints, it could be a sign of either disease. Your doctor can set you straight, but there are some key ways to tell them apart. Lupus affects everybody differently. The way you feel may not be the same as your friend who also has the disease. Most folks will get flares, which means the condition gets worse at certain times and then gets better. The symptoms can come on slowly or suddenly, and can be permanent or temporary. Some things you may notice if you have lupus are: A rash shaped like a butterfly that covers your nose and cheeks You feel tired Pain, stiffness, or swelling in your joints Fever Sensitivity to sun or light that causes skin lesions White or blue color in your fingers and toes when you're in the cold or feel stressed Headaches or chest pain Ulcers in your mouth or nose Hair loss Low numbers of blood cells (anemia) Swelling in your hands, feet, or legs Like lupus, your symptoms sometimes get better and sometimes flare up. You may get tired and have pain, swelling, and warmth in your joints. If you have psoriatic arthritis you may get problems like: Severe swelling in your fingers or toes Foot pain, often at the bottom or the heel Pain in your lower back Scaly patches on your skin that flake Pitted or discolored nails It starts when your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- attacks your own organs and tissues. The disease causes inflammation and can affect different parts of your body, including your heart, skin, brain, and blood cells. Experts don't know the exact cause of lupus. They think it may be related to genes that put you at risk for lupus and things you come into contact with that trigger the disease. Some of those triggers are: Sunlight Infections Medications like blood pressure or anti-seizure drugs Psoriatic arthritis can happen if you have psoriasis, a condition that causes your skin to get red patches and silvery scales. Sometimes people get psoriasis first and then have psoriatic arthritis later, but others get the arthritis symptoms first. Like lupus, psoriatic arthritis happens when your immune system attacks your healthy cells and tissues. This causes your joints to get inflamed and your skin to make too many cells. It's not clear what causes the immune system to attack your body when you have psoriatic arthritis, but just like lupus, it's likely that genes and triggers play a role. There's no single test that shows you have lupus. Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you to get some blood and urine tests that give clues about your condition. He may also suggest you get a chest X-ray to look for fluid or inflammation in your lungs or an echocardiogram to see if you have problems with your heart. Your doctor may say you have lupus if you have at least four of 11 signs of the disease that are laid out by experts at the American College of Rheumatology: Butterfly-shaped rash Raised red patches on your skin You're sensitive to light Ulcers in your mouth or nose Arthritis in two or more joints, plus swelling or tenderness Inflammation in the lining of your heart or lungs Seizures or other nerve problems Too much protein in your urine Low blood cell counts Certain antibodies in your blood Results from a blood test called an ANA test that suggest you may have too many \"antinuclear\" antibodies, which could be a sign of lupus To check if you have psoriatic arthritis, you may need to get certain tests like X-rays to look at changes in your bones or joints, and blood tests that check for inflammation. Your doctor may also do a physical exam to see if you have inflammation and swelling in your joints or signs of psoriasis on your skin and nails. He will ask you about your medical history. Your doctor will probably rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. For example, if you only have swelling and pain in a single joint, you may have gout.
