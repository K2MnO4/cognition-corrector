The grief process is normal, and most people go through it. But when grief takes over your life and you begin to feel hopeless, helpless, and worthless, then it's time to talk to your doctor about telling the difference between normal grief and depression. Grief is a natural response to death or loss. The grieving process is an opportunity to appropriately mourn a loss and then heal. The process is helped when you acknowledge grief, find support, and allow time for grief to work. Each year, between 5% and 9% of the population loses a close family member. But that's not the only kind of loss that can cause grief. People can feel loss when: They become separated from a loved one They lose a job, position, or income A pet dies or runs away Kids leave home They have a major change in life such as getting a divorce, moving, or retiring While we all feel grief and loss, and each of us is unique in the ways we cope with our feelings. Some people have healthy coping skills. They're able to feel grief without losing sight of their daily responsibilities. Other people don't have the coping skills or support they need. That hinders the grieving process. There are specific stages of grief. They reflect common reactions people have as they try to make sense of a loss. An important part of the healing process is feeling and accepting the emotions that come as a result of the loss. People go through common stages of grief: Denial, numbness, and shock: Numbness is a normal reaction to a death or loss and should never be confused with \"not caring.\" This stage of grief helps protect us from experiencing the intensity of the loss. It can be useful when we have to take some action, such as planning a funeral, notifying relatives, or reviewing important papers. As we move through the experience and slowly acknowledges its impact, the initial denial and disbelief fades. Bargaining: This stage of grief may be marked by persistent thoughts about what \"could have been done\" to prevent the death or loss. Some people become obsessed with thinking about specific ways things could have been done differently to save the person's life or prevent the loss. If this stage of grief isn't dealt with and resolved, the person may live with intense feelings of guilt or anger that can interfere with the healing process. Depression: In this stage, we begin to realize and feel the true extent of the death or loss. Common signs of depression in this stage include trouble sleeping, poor appetite, fatigue, lack of energy, and crying spells. We may also have self-pity and feel lonely, isolated, empty, lost, and anxious. Anger: This stage is common. It usually happens when we feel helpless and powerless. Anger can stem from a feeling of abandonment because of a death or loss. Sometimes we're angry at a higher power, at the doctors who cared for a lost loved one, or toward life in general. Acceptance: In time, we can come to terms with all the emotions and feelings we experienced when the death or loss happened. Healing can begin once the loss becomes integrated into our set of life experiences. Throughout our lives, we may return to some of the earlier stages of grief, such as depression or anger. Because there are no rules or time limit to the grieving process, everyone's healing process will be different. Some things can impede or slow down the healing process following a death or loss. They include: Avoiding emotions Compulsive behaviors Minimizing feelings Overworking on the job Misusing drugs, alcohol, or other substances as a way to deal with emotional discomfort Acknowledge and accept both positive and negative feelings. Allow plenty of time to experience thoughts and feelings. Confide in a trusted person about the loss. Express feelings openly or write journal entries about them. Find bereavement groups in which there are other people who've had similar losses. Remember that crying can provide a release. Seek professional help if feelings are overwhelming. If grief continues and causes a prolonged and deep depression with physical symptoms such as poor sleep, loss of appetite, weight loss, and even thoughts of suicide, you may have a condition known as complicated bereavement. Talk with your doctor as soon as possible. Sometimes, a major depression can develop along with the normal feelings of loss or sadness linked with grief. Whereas normal sadness as part of a grief reaction may subside after several months, major depression is a medical disorder that is different from normal grief, can occur at any time (even in the immediate aftermath of a death of loss), and requires treatment to be resolved.", "question": "Can a doctor help me tell the difference between grief and depression?", "answer": ["The grief process is normal, and most people go through it.

Your doctor may suggest diet changes, depending on your symptoms. He may also recommend vitamins or nutritional supplements. Some people get surgery to remove part or all of the colon. Your doctor may suggest this if your medicine isn't working, your symptoms get worse, or your ulcerative colitis leads to serious complications.

You may have had a small hole in it or something more severe. Although these can be very serious conditions, many can be treated with surgery. In some cases, doctors can find these problems during pregnancy. You might not get symptoms until adulthood, or you may not get any at all. Doctors don't always know why a baby has a congenital heart defect. They tend to run in families. Things that make them more likely include: Problems with genes or chromosomes in the child, such as Down syndrome Taking certain medications, or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy A viral infection, like rubella ( German measles) in the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy Most congenital heart problems are structural issues like holes and leaky valves. For instance: Heart valve defects: One may be too narrow or completely closed. That makes it hard for blood to get through. Sometimes, it can't get through at all. In other cases, the valve might not close properly, so the blood leaks backward. Problems with the heart's \"walls\": It could be the ones between the chambers (atria and ventricles) of your heart. Holes or passageways between the left and right side of the heart might cause blood to mix when it shouldn't. Issues with the heart's muscle: These can lead to heart failure, which means the heart doesn't pump as efficiently as it should. Bad connections among blood vessels: In babies, this may let blood that should go to the lungs go to other parts of the body instead, or vice versa. These defects can deprive blood of oxygen and lead to organ failure. It's possible for you to have a heart-related birth defect and not have symptoms. If you do, they can include: Shortness of breath Problems with exercise The symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and children may include: A bluish tint to the skin, fingernails, and lips (doctors call this cyanosis, a condition caused by a lack of oxygenated blood) Fast breathing and poor feeding Poor weight gain Lung infections An inability to exercise Doctors may find some problems before a baby is born. Other problems may be found in infants, kids, or adults. The doctor listens to your heartbeat to check your health. If she hears an unusual sound or heart murmur, she might order more tests, such as: Echocardiogram: A type of ultrasound that takes pictures of your heart. There are different kinds, so ask your doctor what you can expect. Cardiac catheterization: A doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. She puts dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart. Chest X-ray: These can reveal signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG): This measures the heart's electrical activity. MRI : You get a scan that lets doctors see the heart's structure. You might not need any treatment. Or you may need medications, surgery, or other procedures. If you have congenital heart disease, you'll need to see a heart specialist on a regular basis. People with congenital heart defects are more likely to have inflammation of the inner layer of their heart (a condition doctors call endocarditis), especially if their heart was repaired or replaced through surgery. To protect yourself: Tell all doctors and dentists you have congenital heart disease. You may want to carry a card with this information. Call your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection (sore throat, general body aches, fever). Take good care of your teeth and gums to prevent infections. Make regular visits to your dentist.

It's the first drug most doctors prescribe after you're diagnosed. It will help ease symptoms like joint pain, fatigue, redness, and swelling. It may also help prevent damage to your organs and joints. Methotrexate interrupts the process that causes RA inflammation, which damages your joints and organs over time. Your doctor may call it a â DMARD,â which is a type of RA drug. ( DMARD stands for disease-modifying antirheumatic drug). You can take methotrexate in either pills or shots. There are prefilled methotrexate shots that are easy to take at home. You will take 7.5 to 10 milligrams each week. Your doctor may raise that to 20-25 milligrams per week if needed. The pills will come with directions about how many to take and when. If you're not sure about those instructions, ask your doctor or a pharmacist. Shots work better for some people, especially if you forget to take your pills on schedule or if the pills cause nausea. Methotrexate liquid comes in vials with a hypodermic needle or in prefilled pens with various doses. You inject the drug under the skin on your stomach or thigh. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this at home. If you use a prefilled pen, you'll stick the pen into your stomach or thigh and press on it to inject the drug. Try to give yourself your shot in a different spot each time. This will help you avoid skin reactions. It can take 3 to 6 weeks to start to feel your methotrexate work. It takes even longer -- 12 weeks -- to get the full effects. Your doctor will test your blood often to check on how well your treatment works and to make sure it's safe for organs such as your liver. Your doctor may prescribe methotrexate alone. Or you may also take other drugs like aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, low-dose steroids, or other DMARDs. You'll probably take folic acid supplements along with methotrexate. This vitamin can help you lower your chance of certain side effects. Talk to your doctor before you take any drug or supplement. Not all drugs mix well. You may notice these side effects while you take methotrexate: Dizziness Drowsiness Headaches Swollen or tender gums Hair loss Decreased appetite Mouth sores Rash Diarrhea Tell your doctor if you have them. He can adjust your dose so you feel better. Minor side effects should lessen over time. This drug can harm your liver. You'll visit the doctor regularly to check on how methotrexate affects your body. Your doctor might test your liver as often as once a month for the first 6 months you take the drug. After that, you may get a liver test every 3 months. You're more likely to get an infection while you take methotrexate. So take these steps to stay well: Try to avoid people with infections like colds or flu. Wash your hands regularly. Tell your doctor if you have fever, chills, or a cough. Don't take live vaccines like the nasal flu mist, measles, mumps, or shingles shots while you take methotrexate. Methotrexate can also: Cause lung problems. Tell your doctor if you cough frequently or have shortness of breath. Make lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system) more likely. Make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Use sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and don't use sunlamps or tanning beds. Cause birth defects. If you or your partner could get pregnant, you should use birth control while on methotrexate. Men should continue to use protection for 3 months after the last dose. Women should stay on birth control for at least 1 menstrual cycle after the last dose and not breastfeed while taking methotrexate.", "question": "How does methotrexate treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?", "answer": ["It's the first drug most doctors prescribe after you're diagnosed.

{"id": "70a8edcd530141f613dc4f29c12bc42a", "url": "https://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/qa/how-does-cancer-immunotherapy-work", "subject": "", "topic": "", "context": "Could immunotherapy, a type of cancer treatment that uses your body's own immune system to fight tumors, help people with mesothelioma? Early research shows benefits for this hard-to-treat form of cancer. Mesothelioma often starts in your pleura, a thin lining between your lung and the inside of your chest. Usually, it affects people who've breathed in asbestos, a material used in roofing and insulation. Tiny asbestos fibers go into your lungs and cause cancer cells to grow in the lining. Right now, the only FDA-approved mesothelioma treatments are chemotherapy, like cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pemetrexed. Doctors are looking at other options, like immunotherapy, that could offer hope. Where Is Immunotherapy Now? Larger clinical trials with more mesothelioma patients will offer a better look at how well immunotherapy works and what side effects it can cause. These drugs are being studied for mesothelioma now: Atezolizumab ( Tecentriq) Durvalumab ( Imfinzi) Ipilimumab ( Yervoy) Nivolumab ( Opdivo) Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) Tremelimumab How Does Immunotherapy Work? Unlike chemotherapy drugs, which kill both cancer and healthy cells, immunotherapy is more targeted. It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer. White blood cells in your immune system spot cells that aren't supposed to be in your body, like bacteria or viruses. Immunotherapy drugs tell the white blood cells to sense certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells, then seek out and destroy those cells. Block the Blocker It sounds simple, but in mesothelioma, these proteins can block your immune system's attack. They're called checkpoints. They distract your white blood cells so they don't attack the cancer inside. Checkpoint proteins include PD-1 and PD- L1. Immunotherapy drugs like atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab are called checkpoint inhibitors because they block the proteins' defense. Checkpoints normally act as an off switch for immune cells attacking tumor cells. Immunotherapy reveals the tumor cells. The checkpoint inhibitor pulls the mask off so the immune cells can do their job. When Is It Used? Mesothelioma is hard to treat because its tumor cells are high in checkpoints. So current trials test different mixes of immunotherapy drugs, as well as use of immunotherapy to rev up your immune system before cancer surgery. The results: People who've failed other treatments often respond well to immunotherapy. Right now, immunotherapy is mainly given to people with mesothelioma in clinical trials.. So how and when do you know if you should sign up for one? Every trial is different. Each has its own requirements for who can enroll based on the type of mesothelioma you have and what treatments you've already tried that didn't work. You and your doctor can talk about immunotherapy when you're diagnosed and go over your treatment options. The type of mesothelioma you have and how far it has spread will help you decide if you should try chemotherapy or surgery first. Usually, you go into a drug trial if other treatments have failed. But some mesothelioma immunotherapy trials don't require that. How Do You Take Immunotherapy? These drugs are all given as infusions, so you go to a clinic to get an IV drip every 2 to 3 weeks. Immunotherapy can cause side effects including diarrhea, nausea, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, and inflamed organs. Next Steps Researchers want to find biomarkers, like genes or those proteins on the tumors, that could help immunotherapy drugs better hit their targets. Also, most people don't respond to a single drug, so scientists are looking into combinations with surgery, other cancer drugs, and other immunotherapies. More trials on more patients with mesothelioma may tell us how well they work in different types of this cancer, and why they seem to work when other drugs have failed. Doctors will go back and figure out why people had the response they did, whether it was partial or very good. One day, you might not have to wait until other treatments fail first to try immunotherapy. If things keep going the way they are, it could soon become a front-line treatment for mesothelioma.", "question": "How does cancer immunotherapy work?", "answer": ["It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer.

It itches. It burns. It hurts. So when a flare turns painful, you want relief -- ASAP. Having some remedies on hand can soothe your sore skin when you need it the most. Before you do anything, make sure you don't have a bigger problem on your hands. If the pain is really bad or your skin is crusty yellow or oozing, call your doctor. That's a sign of an infection. It can spread and become much worse than a regular flare. You may need an antibiotic. Otherwise, try these self-care tips for the pain and itch. Quench thirsty skin. Your psoriasis may be uncomfortable because your skin is dry, scaly, and inflamed. A moisturizer is your friend. Thicker or greasier is usually better. Pick creams and ointments that come in a tub or tube. Lotions, on the other hand, tend to be watered down. Look for moisturizers with an ingredient called ceramide. Even something as basic as petroleum jelly can help your skin and lock in moisture. Soften scales. Lotions with salicylic, lactic, or glycolic acids can break up dead skins cells that build up on psoriasis plaques. Slather it on at night and cover the area with plastic wrap. This helps keep the lotion in place so you skin absorbs it better. Turn up the heat. The ingredient that makes chili peppers hot can ease pain. Check your drugstore for products with capsaicin. This can block nerve endings that transmit pain. One study showed it may help psoriasis pain, redness, swelling and other symptoms. Knock out itch. Several over-the-counter medications can control itch -- which can feel more like a burning or biting feeling when you have psoriasis. Ask your pharmacist for lotions and creams with pramoxine or menthol. Hydrocortisone, a mild steroid, can help, too. Resist the urge to scratch. That only makes it worse and can injure you skin, which makes it hurt even more. Chill out. Cold packs can take the itch out by short-circuiting the itch-scratch cycle. They âconfuseâ your brain because it's hard for it to feel itch and cold at the same time. Take a soak. Draw a warm bath and sprinkle in some Epsom salts. Soak for about 15 minutes.

This means you'll get more than one treatment at the same time to attack the cancer cells. Years ago, the main weapons that doctors used to fight cancer were surgery, chemotherapy (strong medicine that kills healthy cells along with cancer cells), and radiation. Today, there are many new tools, like immunotherapy, which boosts your body's own immune system to help it fight cancer, and targeted therapy, which targets and attacks certain mutated genes or proteins that are in some forms of cancer without harming normal cells. Often, when doctors combine two or more ways fight cancer, they have a greater result than when they use only one cancer-fighting weapon at a time. This type of treatment lets them attack cancer from many angles at the same time, so there are fewer places for it to hide. This makes it more likely that the treatments will help. Your doctor will decide what type is best for you based on your health and the type of melanoma you have. He'll also choose the best option to try first. Some treatments may never be right for you, if your form of melanoma doesn't have certain mutated genes or proteins. You may have more severe side effects than if you only got one treatment at a time. Your doctor may choose to stop one if the side effects are too severe. He may also stop a treatment if you don't improve by a certain time. Your doctor may suggest these combinations: Research has shown that using two drugs to treat stage IV melanoma works better than using just one. Cancer can trick your immune system into leaving it alone. These meds âwake upâ your body so you can fight back. When ipilimumab ( Yervoy) is paired with either nivolumab ( Opdivo) or pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) survival rates are better than treating with ipilimumab alone. Your doctor will know whether or not this drug combo is right for you. You could be more likely to have a serious heart problem or other severe side effects than if you only took one of the drugs. Some of today's newer cancer treatments target certain mutated genes or proteins that cancer needs to thrive or survive. If your melanoma has them, you can take a medication to attack them. About half the people with melanoma have a change to their genes called BRAF. Other people have a certain protein called MEK that helps melanoma grow and thrive. If your cancer has them, the doctor may give you a mix of binimetinib ( Mektovi) and encorafenib ( Braftovi), dabrafenib ( Tafinlar) and trametinib ( Mekinist) or two other drugs called cobimetinib ( Cotellic) andvemurafenib ( Zelboraf). They can shrink tumors and help you live longer. But there can be strong side effects. Chemotherapy isn't the first treatment choice for melanoma. But some patients with stage IV melanoma do get chemo drugs as a type of combination therapy. There are a number of drugs that your doctor can choose from, and it's likely that you'll receive more than one such drug at a time. This mix works well to shrink tumors, but it may also cause more side effects. Doctors are testing other forms of combination therapy for melanoma in clinical trials. Several treatments look like they may have promise. Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is right for you. These treatments may be available outside of clinical trials if they prove to be worthy: A combination of immunotherapy drugs for people who have less-advanced melanoma A combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for people with stage IV melanoma A combination of immunotherapy and radiation (which is called radioimmunotherapy) for people with melanoma. Right now, doctors use it to treat certain types of lymphoma, which is another form of cancer.

For the purposes of this question, \"cancer\" includes some kinds of tumors (such as lung, breast, endometrium, prostate, and some kidney cancers).  immunotherapy is used to prevent cancer.,2-oxytocin, has the potential to be used in cases of cancers known to involve the lung and throat, as well as certain types of stomach and bladder cancer. In addition to using this medicine, doctors will also recommend that the patient take calcium, which is absorbed into the body through the gastrointestinal tract. Cancer treatment involves using medication to treat and stop the disease. How does immunotherapy help treat cancer? In cancer therapy, doctors use immune system-activating drugs to fight the cancer cells. During the immune system's fight against cancer, doctors typically use chemotherapy to stop the cancer's growth. How is immunotherapy used in certain patients? While it is not possible to accurately diagnose a specific patient with immunotherapy, several types of immune-system suppressing therapies have been used by the United States Preventive"}

This means you'll get more than one treatment at the same time to attack the cancer cells. Years ago, the main weapons that doctors used to fight cancer were surgery, chemotherapy (strong medicine that kills healthy cells along with cancer cells), and radiation. Today, there are many new tools, like immunotherapy, which boosts your body's own immune system to help it fight cancer, and targeted therapy, which targets and attacks certain mutated genes or proteins that are in some forms of cancer without harming normal cells. Often, when doctors combine two or more ways fight cancer, they have a greater result than when they use only one cancer-fighting weapon at a time. This type of treatment lets them attack cancer from many angles at the same time, so there are fewer places for it to hide. This makes it more likely that the treatments will help. Your doctor will decide what type is best for you based on your health and the type of melanoma you have. He'll also choose the best option to try first. Some treatments may never be right for you, if your form of melanoma doesn't have certain mutated genes or proteins. You may have more severe side effects than if you only got one treatment at a time. Your doctor may choose to stop one if the side effects are too severe. He may also stop a treatment if you don't improve by a certain time. Your doctor may suggest these combinations: Research has shown that using two drugs to treat stage IV melanoma works better than using just one. Cancer can trick your immune system into leaving it alone. These meds âwake upâ your body so you can fight back. When ipilimumab ( Yervoy) is paired with either nivolumab ( Opdivo) or pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) survival rates are better than treating with ipilimumab alone. Your doctor will know whether or not this drug combo is right for you. You could be more likely to have a serious heart problem or other severe side effects than if you only took one of the drugs. Some of today's newer cancer treatments target certain mutated genes or proteins that cancer needs to thrive or survive. If your melanoma has them, you can take a medication to attack them. About half the people with melanoma have a change to their genes called BRAF. Other people have a certain protein called MEK that helps melanoma grow and thrive. If your cancer has them, the doctor may give you a mix of binimetinib ( Mektovi) and encorafenib ( Braftovi), dabrafenib ( Tafinlar) and trametinib ( Mekinist) or two other drugs called cobimetinib ( Cotellic) andvemurafenib ( Zelboraf). They can shrink tumors and help you live longer. But there can be strong side effects. Chemotherapy isn't the first treatment choice for melanoma. But some patients with stage IV melanoma do get chemo drugs as a type of combination therapy. There are a number of drugs that your doctor can choose from, and it's likely that you'll receive more than one such drug at a time. This mix works well to shrink tumors, but it may also cause more side effects. Doctors are testing other forms of combination therapy for melanoma in clinical trials. Several treatments look like they may have promise. Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is right for you. These treatments may be available outside of clinical trials if they prove to be worthy: A combination of immunotherapy drugs for people who have less-advanced melanoma A combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy for people with stage IV melanoma A combination of immunotherapy and radiation (which is called radioimmunotherapy) for people with melanoma.

The other is an advanced form of amyloidosis, which is rare and is not associated with a family history of amyloidosis.\n3. How can amyloidosis occur?\nAnswer: Amyloidosis occurs when amyloid proteins build up inside cells in the brain, causing them to be misfolded into insoluble pieces of protein. This process, known as neurofibrillary tangles, is thought to play a role in brain and spinal cord diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, but has not been proved definitively. A different form of neurofibrillary tangles, known as diffuse axonal injury, may occur after a stroke. The best treatments for the early stages of neurofibrillary tangles are surgery, and if necessary chemotherapy.\n4. If neurofibrillary tangles become permanent, is amyloidosis possible?\nAnswer:"}

Bulging discs: The stuff inside your discs âbulges,â but not as much as with a herniated disc. They often cause no symptoms on their own, but they can bring pain if the disc pushes up against a nerve root. Degenerative disc disease: The discs that separate your vertebrae wear down. This sometimes causes the bones to rub together. Age is usually the reason, but sports and injuries can be culprits, too. Inflammation and movement problems of the sacroiliac joint: This joint sits at the bottom of the spine, on either side of the pelvis. It transfers the weight of your upper body to your lower body. This can start to bother you after you've been injured, if you have an infection, if you have arthritis, or if you're pregnant. Abnormal movement, such as too much movement of the joint, can also cause long-term pain. Lumbar spinal stenosis : If you're over age 60, there's a decent chance this is your culprit. As you age, your spinal canal narrows. That change can put pressure on the nerves running through your spine. Your shoulders and legs will then start to feel numb. Cauda equina syndrome: This happens if a ruptured disc pushes down into the nerve roots in your spine. It may be what's causing your pain if bladder and bowel control have been an issue for you lately. Cervical radiculopathy : This is a pinched nerve in your neck that is usually caused by a bone spur or herniated disc. Sciatica: This may be your cause if you have a sharp pain in your lower back or hip. It happens when a herniated disc presses on the nerves in your lower spine. Arthritis: This causes stiffness, swelling, and inflammation in your joints. If your doctor mentions âankylosing spondylitis,â he's talking about a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the joints and ligaments along your spine. Osteoarthritis : This is when your cartilage and bone begin to break down and there is inflammation. Scoliosis: You may hear this called âcurvature of the spine.â If you have it, chances are you were born with it. Pain tied to it usually starts at about middle age. Spondylolisthesis: If your doctor mentions this, a bone in the spine has slipped out of place, probably in your lower back. This can be seen by X-ray or MRI. Spinal stenosis: This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that causes pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. It's usually from arthritis or bony growth from wear and tear. Lower back pain can also be caused by other things that are going on in your body. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: If the blood vessel that supplies blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs is at risk of rupturing, you'll feel sudden pain in your lower back. Pregnancy: All that weight out front can put a real strain on your back. Tumors: They usually don't start in the back, but are part of the spread of a cancer in the spine that started somewhere else in your body. Infections: Osteomyelitis, discitis and, septic sacroiliitis are uncommon infections that affect the bones, discs, and joints of the spine. Any one of these can cause pain in your lower back.

See the answer to question 3.\nFigure 2. The vertebral disc. Source: Wiki\nScoliosis is often accompanied by orthopedic or other complications that may lead to disability. However, because scoliosis can be prevented or treated and the condition tends to recur at a younger age, many children with scoliosis will not develop problems with mobility or development. For example, most children with scoliosis who do not develop scoliosis are not restricted from working. In children with scoliosis, hip, knee or elbow arthritis are common. To determine if any of these conditions are present, check your child's doctor's records or get a physical examination. A physical examination includes an X-ray, physical examination (such as a scan), and a blood test. In children younger than 5,"}

Do not confuse the sacroiliac joint with the sacrum, a small muscle-like structure. The sacrosa is an outer layer of the spinal cord.  A symphalus is a small cluster of cells in the spinal cord that help coordinate the movement of nerve impulses throughout the body. The term often refers to the small sacs that cover the entire spinal cord (hindi).  spinal stenosis occurs when the sacrum or another portion of the spinal cord are damaged due to trauma, disease, radiation, or surgery, which can cause a portion of the spinal cord to become inflammed and unable to move freely. (Sciatic nerve disease occurs in approximately one in 1,000 patients.) Sciatica is also the name for an abnormal pressure on the small sac of the lower back. If any portion of the spinal cord is affected, back pain may result. The condition is typically diagnosed by an imaging examination. If pain persists, visit your doctor to rule out other possible causes of the condition."}

Cauda equina syndrome: This happens if a ruptured disc pushes down into the nerve roots in your spine. It may be what's causing your pain if bladder and bowel control have been an issue for you lately. Cervical radiculopathy : This is a pinched nerve in your neck that is usually caused by a bone spur or herniated disc. Sciatica: This may be your cause if you have a sharp pain in your lower back or hip. It happens when a herniated disc presses on the nerves in your lower spine. Arthritis: This causes stiffness, swelling, and inflammation in your joints. If your doctor mentions âankylosing spondylitis,â he's talking about a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the joints and ligaments along your spine. Osteoarthritis : This is when your cartilage and bone begin to break down and there is inflammation. Scoliosis: You may hear this called âcurvature of the spine.â If you have it, chances are you were born with it. Pain tied to it usually starts at about middle age. Spondylolisthesis: If your doctor mentions this, a bone in the spine has slipped out of place, probably in your lower back. This can be seen by X-ray or MRI. Spinal stenosis: This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that causes pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. It's usually from arthritis or bony growth from wear and tear. Lower back pain can also be caused by other things that are going on in your body. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: If the blood vessel that supplies blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs is at risk of rupturing, you'll feel sudden pain in your lower back. Pregnancy: All that weight out front can put a real strain on your back. Tumors: They usually don't start in the back, but are part of the spread of a cancer in the spine that started somewhere else in your body. Infections: Osteomyelitis, discitis and, septic sacroiliitis are uncommon infections that affect the bones, discs, and joints of the spine. Any one of these can cause pain in your lower back. Kidney infections can also cause your back to feel the brunt. Other issues: Low back pain can also happen because of things like: Kidney stones Endometriosis, a buildup of uterine tissue outside the uterus Fibromyalgia, a condition that causes widespread muscle pain", "question": "What are herniated or slipped discs and how can they cause back pain?", "answer": ["If your back isn't feeling quite right, have your doctor check for: Herniated or slipped discs: The bones of your spine are cushioned by discs, often referred to as âshock absorbers.â When they wear down, the soft tissue between them begins to squeeze out. This is when you start to feel it -- especially if they rupture. It can happen if you've had a sudden injury, or because of simple wear and tear."], "generated_answer": "What should I do? Answer options include an MRI, spinal adjustment, and physical therapy. What are the typical outcomes for these conditions? Most patients do not require therapy. In some cases, the patient may be referred to a rehabilitation program for physical therapy. How can I avoid back pain or injury while working out? This means stretching and strengthening the muscles that are most important for working out. Do you need an exercise program to help reduce back pain? Sometimes back pain can be relieved by exercises and treatments called spinal manipulations. Are chiropractic manipulations good for back pain? Although spinal manipulation is not recommended for preventing or treating back pain, chiropractors suggest it as a treatment for various illnesses, including back pain. What are the most common types of chiropractic manipulation? There are three kinds of chiropractic manipulation that can be done. They are: cervical (CIS) manipulation\n\nknee (LASIK) manipulation, and\n\nspine manipulation, or spinal decompression. Is spinal decompression recommended for preventing or treating back pain? While spinal decompression can help relieve back pain, it is not recommended for preventing or treating back pain. What is the best way to prevent back pain? This is a question that many people struggle with."}

They make it hard for your child's body to remove waste products as he digests proteins. They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child. In most cases, you can manage them with diet and medications. When your baby eats protein, his body breaks it down into amino acids and uses what he needs. What he doesn't need is further broken down into waste products that his body removes. This happens in a process called the urea cycle. Your baby's liver makes things called enzymes that turn waste nitrogen into urea. The urea leaves his body in his urine. If your child has a urea cycle disorder, his liver can't make one of the enzymes the cycle needs. When his body can't remove nitrogen, ammonia forms and collects in his blood. It's toxic and can cause brain damage or put him in a coma. It can even be fatal if you don't treat it quickly. UCDs affect about 1 in 30,000-35,000 newborns. There are eight types. They're named after what's missing from the urea cycle. You'll also hear doctors call them by their initials: ARG1 deficiency -- Arginase ASL deficiency -- Argininosuccinate lyase ASS1 deficiency -- Argininosuccinate synthase 1 Citrin deficiency -- Citrin CPSI deficiency -- Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I NAGS deficiency -- N-acetylglutamate synthase ORNT1 deficiency -- Ornithine translocase OTC deficiency -- Ornithine transcarbamylase Parents pass these diseases down to their children through defective genes. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child's body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome, and they mostly pass it to their sons. UCDs fall into two groups: Complete UCD: This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You'll notice symptoms in the first couple of days: Fussy Sleepy or sluggish Can't feed Vomits Low body temperature Problems with posture Seizures Fast breathing that becomes slow Coma Partial UCD: Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as he needs. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years. A buildup of ammonia (you may hear the doctor call it hyperammonemia) can happen from illness, injury, stress, or quick weight loss. Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include: Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Behavior problems, including hyperactivity Mental problems (confusion, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis) Most newborns in the U. S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies. If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam. They'll ask about your family history and do tests. They'll look for ammonia in your child's blood and amino acid in his blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of his liver through a process called biopsy. They'll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis. UCDs are life-threatening. Don't wait to get treatment. A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time: Dialysis to remove ammonia from his blood Feeding him supplements of sugars, fats, and amino acids Medicines to remove extra nitrogen Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout his life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on his body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause his levels to rise. During those times, you'll need to give him extra calories so his body has plenty of fuel. Long-term treatment will include: A low protein, high-calorie diet Medications to remove nitrogen Supplements of amino acids Drinking plenty of water A liver transplant can reverse the symptoms of a urea cycle disorder. There's no cure for UCDs. Your child's long-term health depends on which UCD he has, how severe it is, how early it was diagnosed, and how closely you follow the treatment plan.

They stop abnormal electrical signals that move through your heart and cause an irregular heartbeat (the doctor might call it arrhythmia). Cardiac ablation can also treat atrial fibrillation ( AFib), also a type of irregular heartbeat. The doctor may try cardiac ablation if medications and resetting your heartbeat -- he'll probably refer to it as cardioversion -- don't work. Catheter ablation, also called radiofrequency or pulmonary vein ablation, isn't surgery, and it's the least invasive option. Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into a blood vessel in your leg or neck. Then, it's guided to your heart. When it reaches the area that's causing the arrhythmia, It sends out electrical signals that destroy those cells. The treated tissue helps get your heartbeat regular again. There are two main types: Radiofrequency ablation: The doctor uses catheters to send radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) that creates circular scars around each vein or group of veins. Cryoablation: A single catheter sends a balloon tipped with a substance that freezes the tissues to cause a scar. Surgical ablation involves cutting into your chest. There are three kinds: Maze procedure: This is usually done while you're having open-heart surgery for another problem, like a bypass or valve replacement. The surgeon makes small cuts in the upper part of the heart. They're stitched together to form the scar tissue that stops abnormal signals. Mini maze: Most people with AFib don't need open-heart surgery. That's where this less invasive option comes in. The doctor makes several small cuts between your ribs and uses a camera to guide catheters for either cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation. Some hospitals offer robotic-assisted surgery that uses smaller cuts and makes the procedure more precise. Your doctor will put a video camera or tiny robot into your chest. It'll guide the creation of scar tissue that may help keep your heartbeat at the right pace. Convergent procedure: This pairs catheter ablation with a mini maze. The doctor uses radiofrequency ablation in the pulmonary vein, and a surgeon makes a small cut under your breastbone to use radiofrequency energy on the outside of your heart. You and your doctor will talk about AFib treatment options, including ablation. The plan will depend on: The cause of your AFib Whether you have symptoms Your chance of having heart disease Different types of ablation target different parts of your heart. You may be able to go home the same day, or you may need to stay a night or longer in the hospital. Drugs can treat the AFib and keep your heart at a regular rhythm, but they may cause side effects or stop working. Cardiac ablation might be the next option. It can provide a treatment that lasts longer or cures the AFib. Nonsurgical and less invasive ablation are successful for many people with AFib. If the first procedure is not successful, often a second will be. With those options, you'll be able to recover and get back to your normal routine quickly. More than likely you'll need to: Stop eating or drinking the night before the procedure. Stop taking medications to treat arrhythmia several days before. Ask the doctor if you should stop any other medications. Ask the doctor about precautions if you have a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator. The doctor will provide any other special instructions. If you don't treat AFib, your odds of getting blood clots, heart failure, or stroke go up. These could be life-threatening. The doctor will take your risk factors into account before he suggests a treatment. If you have no symptoms, or they're mild, he may watch and wait. But he might prescribe warfarin or another blood thinner to protect you from strokes. Cardiac ablation may be right for you if AFib symptoms are more severe and make it hard to do daily tasks It depends on what type of procedure you have: Catheter ablation: You may need to spend a night in the hospital, but most people go home the same day. If so, you'll rest in a recovery room for a few hours while a nurse closely watches your heart rate and blood pressure. You need to lie flat and still to prevent bleeding from where your skin was cut. Plan to have someone drive you. The doctor will prescribe a medication to prevent blood clots and another to prevent AFib. You'll probably take them for 2 months. A shower is OK once you're home, but keep the water on the cooler side. Don't take a bath, swim, or soak for 5 days or until the cuts have healed. For the first week: Don't lift more than 10 pounds. Skip activities that make you push or pull heavy things -- don't shovel show or mow the lawn. If you get tired, stop and rest. Don't exercise -- you can go back to normal in week two. Maze procedure: You'll probably be in the hospital about a week. You'll spend the first couple of days in an intensive care unit ( ICU), then move to a regular room before you go home. Full recovery takes about 6-8 weeks, but you should be able to return to normal activities within 2-3 weeks. You should start to feel better in about 4 weeks. You'll probably take a blood thinner for about 3 months. Mini maze: You'll be in the ICU for a few hours to a day. You'll probably stay for 2-4 days total. Open-heart maze: This is major surgery. You'll spend a day or two in intensive care, and you may be in the hospital up to a week. At first, you'll feel very tired and have some chest pain. You can probably go back to work in about 3 months, but it may take 6 months to get back to normal. Once you're home: You may need someone to drive you for a while -- the doctor will tell you when you can drive again. You'll probably need help at home. You'll need to go back in about 10 days to get stitches out. Don't lift anything heavy for several weeks. Convergent procedure: Usually requires a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. Recovery is similar to catheter ablation. Any procedure has risks. Problems with cardiac ablation can include: Bleeding or infection where the catheter went in Damaged blood vessels if the catheter scrapes them on its way through Arrhythmias caused by damage to your heart's electrical system Blood clots in your legs or lungs Heart damage, like punctures or damaged valves Stroke or heart attack Narrowing of the veins between your lungs and heart Kidney damage from the dye Radiation Death Catheter ablation may not cure your AFib, but it will often relieve your symptoms. You could still have AFib episodes during the first 3 months, because that's how long it takes for the scars to form. If you've had AFib a long time, you'll likely need a repeat treatment to keep your heartbeat normal. You may also need medicine to control your heart rhythm for a few months after the procedure. Most people who have the maze procedure get long-term relief from their symptoms. And many don't need to take heart rhythm medicine afterward.", "question": "How effective is cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation (AFib)?", "answer": ["Nonsurgical and less invasive ablation are successful for many people with AFib.

It can provide a treatment that lasts longer or cures the AFib. Nonsurgical and less invasive ablation are successful for many people with AFib. If the first procedure is not successful, often a second will be. With those options, you'll be able to recover and get back to your normal routine quickly. More than likely you'll need to: Stop eating or drinking the night before the procedure. Stop taking medications to treat arrhythmia several days before. Ask the doctor if you should stop any other medications. Ask the doctor about precautions if you have a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator. The doctor will provide any other special instructions. If you don't treat AFib, your odds of getting blood clots, heart failure, or stroke go up. These could be life-threatening. The doctor will take your risk factors into account before he suggests a treatment. If you have no symptoms, or they're mild, he may watch and wait. But he might prescribe warfarin or another blood thinner to protect you from strokes. Cardiac ablation may be right for you if AFib symptoms are more severe and make it hard to do daily tasks It depends on what type of procedure you have: Catheter ablation: You may need to spend a night in the hospital, but most people go home the same day. If so, you'll rest in a recovery room for a few hours while a nurse closely watches your heart rate and blood pressure. You need to lie flat and still to prevent bleeding from where your skin was cut. Plan to have someone drive you. The doctor will prescribe a medication to prevent blood clots and another to prevent AFib. You'll probably take them for 2 months. A shower is OK once you're home, but keep the water on the cooler side. Don't take a bath, swim, or soak for 5 days or until the cuts have healed. For the first week: Don't lift more than 10 pounds. Skip activities that make you push or pull heavy things -- don't shovel show or mow the lawn. If you get tired, stop and rest. Don't exercise -- you can go back to normal in week two. Maze procedure: You'll probably be in the hospital about a week. You'll spend the first couple of days in an intensive care unit ( ICU), then move to a regular room before you go home. Full recovery takes about 6-8 weeks, but you should be able to return to normal activities within 2-3 weeks. You should start to feel better in about 4 weeks. You'll probably take a blood thinner for about 3 months. Mini maze: You'll be in the ICU for a few hours to a day. You'll probably stay for 2-4 days total. Open-heart maze: This is major surgery. You'll spend a day or two in intensive care, and you may be in the hospital up to a week. At first, you'll feel very tired and have some chest pain. You can probably go back to work in about 3 months, but it may take 6 months to get back to normal. Once you're home: You may need someone to drive you for a while -- the doctor will tell you when you can drive again. You'll probably need help at home. You'll need to go back in about 10 days to get stitches out. Don't lift anything heavy for several weeks. Convergent procedure: Usually requires a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. Recovery is similar to catheter ablation. Any procedure has risks. Problems with cardiac ablation can include: Bleeding or infection where the catheter went in Damaged blood vessels if the catheter scrapes them on its way through Arrhythmias caused by damage to your heart's electrical system Blood clots in your legs or lungs Heart damage, like punctures or damaged valves Stroke or heart attack Narrowing of the veins between your lungs and heart Kidney damage from the dye Radiation Death Catheter ablation may not cure your AFib, but it will often relieve your symptoms. You could still have AFib episodes during the first 3 months, because that's how long it takes for the scars to form. If you've had AFib a long time, you'll likely need a repeat treatment to keep your heartbeat normal. You may also need medicine to control your heart rhythm for a few months after the procedure. Most people who have the maze procedure get long-term relief from their symptoms.

If you don't treat AFib, your odds of getting blood clots, heart failure, or stroke go up. These could be life-threatening. The doctor will take your risk factors into account before he suggests a treatment. If you have no symptoms, or they're mild, he may watch and wait. But he might prescribe warfarin or another blood thinner to protect you from strokes. Cardiac ablation may be right for you if AFib symptoms are more severe and make it hard to do daily tasks It depends on what type of procedure you have: Catheter ablation: You may need to spend a night in the hospital, but most people go home the same day. If so, you'll rest in a recovery room for a few hours while a nurse closely watches your heart rate and blood pressure. You need to lie flat and still to prevent bleeding from where your skin was cut. Plan to have someone drive you. The doctor will prescribe a medication to prevent blood clots and another to prevent AFib. You'll probably take them for 2 months. A shower is OK once you're home, but keep the water on the cooler side. Don't take a bath, swim, or soak for 5 days or until the cuts have healed. For the first week: Don't lift more than 10 pounds. Skip activities that make you push or pull heavy things -- don't shovel show or mow the lawn. If you get tired, stop and rest. Don't exercise -- you can go back to normal in week two. Maze procedure: You'll probably be in the hospital about a week. You'll spend the first couple of days in an intensive care unit ( ICU), then move to a regular room before you go home. Full recovery takes about 6-8 weeks, but you should be able to return to normal activities within 2-3 weeks. You should start to feel better in about 4 weeks. You'll probably take a blood thinner for about 3 months. Mini maze: You'll be in the ICU for a few hours to a day. You'll probably stay for 2-4 days total. Open-heart maze: This is major surgery. You'll spend a day or two in intensive care, and you may be in the hospital up to a week. At first, you'll feel very tired and have some chest pain. You can probably go back to work in about 3 months, but it may take 6 months to get back to normal. Once you're home: You may need someone to drive you for a while -- the doctor will tell you when you can drive again. You'll probably need help at home. You'll need to go back in about 10 days to get stitches out. Don't lift anything heavy for several weeks. Convergent procedure: Usually requires a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. Recovery is similar to catheter ablation. Any procedure has risks. Problems with cardiac ablation can include: Bleeding or infection where the catheter went in Damaged blood vessels if the catheter scrapes them on its way through Arrhythmias caused by damage to your heart's electrical system Blood clots in your legs or lungs Heart damage, like punctures or damaged valves Stroke or heart attack Narrowing of the veins between your lungs and heart Kidney damage from the dye Radiation Death Catheter ablation may not cure your AFib, but it will often relieve your symptoms. You could still have AFib episodes during the first 3 months, because that's how long it takes for the scars to form. If you've had AFib a long time, you'll likely need a repeat treatment to keep your heartbeat normal. You may also need medicine to control your heart rhythm for a few months after the procedure. Most people who have the maze procedure get long-term relief from their symptoms. And many don't need to take heart rhythm medicine afterward.", "question": "Which type of ablation for atrial fibrillation (AFib) is right for me?", "answer": ["You and your doctor will talk about AFib treatment options, including ablation.

Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it's not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood.

Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it's not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood.

Some viruses, such as the common cold, may cause some leg edema. Infections, such as a urinary tract infection, that cause swelling of the leg may cause leg edema.\n\nEdema occurs for a wide range of reasons, depending on which of several factors are present. In most cases, it is a result of inflammation in the body. Other causes can include infection, bleeding and disease. Sometimes, a fever will occur before symptoms develop. Another indication of illness is swelling of the lower leg and/or foot. The term leg swelling refers to any swelling of the leg. In some cases of leg edema, however, swelling can be in the leg that is affected. In other cases, swelling can be seen only on one leg, or in both legs.\n\nFor general information about medical conditions, see the list of diseases.

This condition occurs when airway constriction decreases, and fluid accumulates. The patient's body fluids dilute, creating a condition called spasm of the heart. Spasm of the heart can trigger edema and can lead to the development of pulmonary hemorrhage.\nCOPD is a disorder of the heart muscle that occurs when the disease progresses or is diagnosed. It can lead to a condition called COPD syndrome. Patients with COPD tend to develop a buildup of fat around the heart due to the excess fluid in the heart. This buildup can lead to thromboembolic events.\nThe body's attempt to control the fluid buildup within the heart through the secretion of vasopressin and prostaglandin-like substances has been termed vasodilation. Vasodilation can also be caused by a defect in the ventricle. This is due to a lack of adequate fluid in the vessel. This, however, is extremely rare.\nThe symptoms of this condition are typically the symptoms of acute coronary syndrome and the heart rhythm disorder known as tachycardia.

It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it's not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide ( Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood.

This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema.

Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body. Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It's more common if you're older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup. Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it's worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area. Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area. Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it's not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness. Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body. Congestive heart failure . When the heart weakens and pumps blood less effectively, fluid can slowly build up, creating leg edema. If fluid builds up quickly, you can get fluid in the lungs. If your heart failure is on the right side of your heart, edema can develop in the abdomen. Liver disease. Severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis, causes you to retain fluid. Cirrhosis also leads to low levels of albumin and other proteins in your blood. Fluid leaks into the abdomen and can also cause leg edema. Kidney disease. A kidney condition called nephrotic syndrome can cause severe leg edema and sometimes whole-body edema. Pregnancy. Mild leg edema is common during pregnancy. But serious complications of pregnancy like deep vein thrombosis and preeclampsia can also cause edema. Head trauma , low blood sodium (called hyponatremia), high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid drainage in the brain (known as hydrocephalus) can cause cerebral edema. So can headaches, confusion, unconsciousness, and coma. Medications. Many medicines can cause edema, including: NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen and naproxen) Calcium channel blockers Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone Pramipexole When they cause swelling, usually it's mild leg edema. Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a âpitâ that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it's called non-pitting edema. It's a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema. To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation.

The answer is that kidney disease can be caused by a number of disorders, the most common being hypertension and cirrhosis.  Type 1 diabetes, called type 1, involves a lack of insulin production in the body. The condition is diagnosed by monitoring your blood sugar level.  Type 2 diabetes, sometimes called type 2, involves a lack of insulin production and is usually not life-threatening. It is diagnosed by monitoring your blood sugar level and checking your cholesterol level.  Finally, there is the more serious form of type 2, known as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). This is an inherited condition that involves excessive cholesterol production in one or both of your parents. While it is not life-threatening, it is very expensive and is considered a rare disorder.  Can you donate blood if you have been diagnosed with a type 1 or type 2 diabetes?  Yes, you can be tested and treated for it if it is present.  However, no one knows how best to treat or prevent the condition. This is because if you are a blood donor, you may never know.

It determines if there's blood in your stool -- a common sign of colon cancer or of precancerous polyps (abnormal growths of tissue).

Now a scar isn't bad if it's small or in a location that's easy to conceal. But when it's not, you may wonder if there's a way to treat it, other than hiding it under your clothes, that will make it go away or at least change how it looks. The truth is the scar will never completely go away. But there are some methods that can help reduce its size and change its appearance. Scarring is a natural part of the healing process after an injury. Its appearance and its treatment depend on multiple factors. The depth and size of the wound or cut and the location of the injury matter. So do your age, genes, sex, and ethnicity. These are several different types of scars including: Keloid scars. These scars are the result of an overly aggressive healing process. They extend beyond the original injury. Over time, a keloid scar may hamper movement. Treatments include surgery to remove the scar, steroid injections, or silicone sheets to flatten the scar. Smaller keloids can be treated using cryotherapy (freezing therapy using liquid nitrogen). You can also prevent keloid formation by using pressure treatment or gel pads with silicone when you are injured. Keloid scars are most common among people with dark skin. Contracture scars. If your skin has been burned, you may have a contracture scar. These scars tighten skin, which can impair your ability to move. Contracture scars may also go deeper, affecting muscles and nerves. Hypertrophic scars. These are raised, red scars that are similar to keloids but do not go beyond the boundary of the injury. Treatments include injections of steroids to reduce inflammation or silicone sheets, which flatten the scar. Acne scars. If you've had severe acne, you probably have the scars to prove it. There are many types of acne scars, ranging from deep pits to scars that are angular or wavelike in appearance. Treatment options depend on the types of acne scars you have. Scar treatments may include: Over-the-counter or prescription creams, ointments, or gels. These products can be used to treat scars that are caused by cuts or other injuries or wounds. If you are under the care of a plastic surgeon and your scarring is from cosmetic or plastic surgery, ask your surgeon if over-the-counter treatment is an option.

There are many options to treat deeper scars depending on your particular case. These include skin grafts, excision, dermabrasion, or laser surgery. In a skin graft, the surgeon uses skin from another area of your body. This is often used with people who've had burns.

Most often, it causes mild infections on the skin, like sores, boils, or abscesses. But it can also cause more serious skin infections or infect surgical wounds, the bloodstream, the lungs, or the urinary tract. Though most MRSA infections aren't serious, some can be life-threatening. Many public health experts are alarmed by the spread of tough strains of MRSA. Because it's hard to treat, MRSA is sometimes called a \"super bug.\" Garden-variety staph are common bacteria that can live in our bodies. Plenty of healthy people carry staph without being infected by it. In fact, one third of everybody has staph bacteria in their noses. But staph can be a problem if it manages to get into the body, often through a cut. Once there, it can cause an infection. Staph is one of the most common causes of skin infections in the U. S. Usually, these are minor and don't need special treatment. Less often, staph can cause serious problems like infected wounds or pneumonia. Staph can usually be treated with antibiotics. But over the decades, some strains of staph -- like MRSA -- have become resistant to antibiotics that once destroyed it. MRSA was first discovered in 1961. It's now resistant to methicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, oxacillin, and other common antibiotics known as cephalosporins. While some antibiotics still work, MRSA is constantly adapting. Researchers developing new antibiotics are having a tough time keeping up. MRSA is spread by contact. So, you could get MRSA by touching another person who has it on the skin. Or you could get it by touching objects that have the bacteria on them. MRSA is carried by about 2% of the population (or 2 in 100 people), although most of them aren't infected. There are two different populations of people who get MRSA -- one is in decline -- those who get it in hospitals or other health care environments -- and the other is on the rise -- those who get it in the community. MRSA infections are common among people who have weak immune systems who are in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care centers. Infections can appear around surgical wounds or invasive devices, like catheters or implanted feeding tubes. According to the CDC, invasive MRSA infections that began in hospitals declined 8% between 2011 and 2013. Community- Associated MRSA ( CA- MRSA) Alarmingly, MRSA is also showing up in healthy people who have not been hospitalized. This type of MRSA is called community-associated MRSA, or CA- MRSA. CA- MRSA skin infections have been identified among certain populations that share close quarters or have more skin-to-skin contact. Examples are team athletes, military recruits, prison inmates, and children in daycare. But more and more CA- MRSA infections are being seen in the general community, especially in certain geographic regions. CA- MRSA is also more likely to affect younger people.

Because the particles are so tiny, the normal defenses in your nose and throat miss them, and they go straight to your lungs. Your lungs then try to get rid of the dust, and your symptoms start when your immune system reacts to that. The most important questions your doctor will ask you will be about your environment.

If your symptoms are mild, your doctor will likely suggest you take a pain reliever. These may include NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. Sometimes endometriosis pain can be severe. So, if you try pain meds that you can buy without a prescription and you don't get enough relief, your doctor will consider whether you need a prescription for a stronger type of medicine. This type of treatment may be a good choice if pain medicines don't help enough. Doctors can prescribe medicines that cut down on how much estrogen your body makes. There are also hormonal meds that can prevent your menstrual period and make areas affected by endometriosis bleed less. That cuts down on inflammation and makes scars and ovarian cysts less likely. The most common hormones that doctors prescribe for endometriosis include: Birth control pills, patches, and vaginal rings. These contraceptives include both estrogen and progestin. Meds that affect gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( Gn RH). You take them either as a nasal spray, shot, or pill. Doctors usually recommend limiting their use to 12 months at a time because of side effects that could affect your heart and bones.

Progestin-only contraceptives. These include pills, shots, and an IUD (intrauterine device). These medicines can cut down on pain, as most women don't have a period while taking these medicines, or at least have fewer periods. Danazol ( Danocrine). This medicine stops your body from releasing hormones that it uses to help bring about your period. You need to be on birth control while you take it to prevent pregnancy. If you get pregnant while taking danazol, it could cause a female baby to have male traits. Hormone therapy can cause side effects such as weight gain, depression, acne, body hair, and irregular bleeding. You should talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits. Also, if you stop taking this type of medicine, your symptoms may come back. Tell your doctor if that happens. Aromatase is a chemical that boosts your body's estrogen production. Aromatase inhibitors block it, which lowers your estrogen level. These medicines aren't routinely used to treat endometriosis.

Although they won't cure the condition, they may help you feel better. Some need a prescription. Others you can buy âover the counter.â Your doctor may recommend that you try more than one kind. If your symptoms are mild, your doctor will likely suggest you take a pain reliever. These may include NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. Sometimes endometriosis pain can be severe. So, if you try pain meds that you can buy without a prescription and you don't get enough relief, your doctor will consider whether you need a prescription for a stronger type of medicine. This type of treatment may be a good choice if pain medicines don't help enough. Doctors can prescribe medicines that cut down on how much estrogen your body makes. There are also hormonal meds that can prevent your menstrual period and make areas affected by endometriosis bleed less. That cuts down on inflammation and makes scars and ovarian cysts less likely. The most common hormones that doctors prescribe for endometriosis include: Birth control pills, patches, and vaginal rings. These contraceptives include both estrogen and progestin. Meds that affect gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( Gn RH). You take them either as a nasal spray, shot, or pill. Doctors usually recommend limiting their use to 12 months at a time because of side effects that could affect your heart and bones. Your doctor may call these Gn RH agonists, analogues, or antagonists: Elagolix ( Orilissa) -- Oral tablet taken twice daily Goserelin ( Zoladex) -- Shot taken once every 28 days Leuprolide ( Lupron) -- Shot taken once every 1 or 3 months Nafarelin ( Synarel) -- Nasal spray taken twice per day Doctors limit the number of months these meds are taken because of bone density loss that can increase the risk of fractures. Progestin-only contraceptives. These include pills, shots, and an IUD (intrauterine device). These medicines can cut down on pain, as most women don't have a period while taking these medicines, or at least have fewer periods. Danazol ( Danocrine). This medicine stops your body from releasing hormones that it uses to help bring about your period. You need to be on birth control while you take it to prevent pregnancy. If you get pregnant while taking danazol, it could cause a female baby to have male traits. Hormone therapy can cause side effects such as weight gain, depression, acne, body hair, and irregular bleeding. You should talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits. Also, if you stop taking this type of medicine, your symptoms may come back. Tell your doctor if that happens. Aromatase is a chemical that boosts your body's estrogen production. Aromatase inhibitors block it, which lowers your estrogen level. These medicines aren't routinely used to treat endometriosis. But in some cases, doctors recommend it \"off label\" in addition to hormonal therapy to manage endometriosis pain, as long as you aren't planning to get pregnant while on this treatment.", "question": "Can aromatase inhibitors help treat endometriosis pain?", "answer": ["Aromatase inhibitors block it, which lowers your estrogen level.

For some endometriosis patients, the treatment can be reversed with surgery.\n\nThe FDA approved aromatase inhibitors for use in the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with endometriosis.\n\nSide effects include diarrhea and nausea, but they are rare.\n\nAlthough some patients continue to have nausea and vomiting, many endometriosis patients are able to manage or avoid the nausea and vomiting in the treatment of endometriosis. However, if the nausea is severe and persists, the woman should see her healthcare provider for evaluation and treatment. If the nausea is severe enough to interfere with the woman's ability to function safely, she should be referred to a urologist for surgery.\n\nFor more information about endometriosis treatment, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But what does it mean if it's green? What about red, yellow, white, and black? Most of the time, minor changes in the color of your waste are due to diet. After all, we don't eat the same thing at every meal, every day. But sometimes a color change can signal a minor health issue. In rare cases, it means something serious is wrong in your digestive system. If the color you see before you flush worries you, call your doctor. Poop is normally brown. The color is the result of what you eat and how much bile is in your stool. Bile is a fluid your liver makes to digest fats. It starts out as a yellowish green color. But as the pigments that give bile its color travel through your digestive system, they go through chemical changes and turn brown. Most of the time, green or greenish poop is normal. Some of the things that can cause it: Green veggies, like spinach or kale Green food coloring, such as in drink mixes or ice pops Iron supplements If you have green diarrhea, the color of your food may not be to blame. It's likely that your meal moved through your gut too quickly, so the fat-digesting bile didn't have time to turn brown. This shade is also normal for many people. It's common for babies, especially those who breastfeed. But if you have yellow poop that looks greasy and smells very bad, it may have too much fat. That could be a sign your body isn't digesting food properly. For example, if you have celiac disease, your body can't handle a protein called gluten, which is in wheat, barley, and rye. If you have the condition and eat foods that have gluten, like many breads, pastas, and cookies, your intestines won't work as they should. There may be other causes of yellow poop that's greasy and smelly. If it happens to you often, tell your doctor. Medicines for diarrhea like bismuth subsalicylate ( Kaopectate, Pepto- Bismol) can sometimes cause pale or clay-colored poop. So can barium, a chalky liquid you drink before you get X-rays of the upper part of your digestive tract. A more serious cause is a lack of bile in your stool. ( Remember, bile gives poop its brown color.) Bile is made in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and released into your small intestine to help digest your food. If there's not enough of it to give your poop its typical brown color, it could be the sign of a problem along the way. Liver disease, such as hepatitis, can keep bile from getting into your body waste. So can a blockage in the tubes (called ducts) that carry bile. This can happen because of: Gallstones Tumor A condition you're born with called biliary atresia Babies' poop is black for the first few days after they're born. After that, it may be because you ate something very dark-colored or took a medicine or supplement that causes black poop. But this color can be a sign of a more serious problem: bleeding in the upper part of your digestive tract. Foods, medicines, and supplements that turn poop black include: Iron supplements Bismuth subsalicylate ( Kaopectate, Pepto- Bismol) Black licorice Blueberries Poop that looks like tar is often a sign of bleeding in the digestive tract. Some causes include: Ulcers Bleeding sores in your esophagus from acid reflux Noncancerous tumors Cancer If you don't think black poop came from what you ate, you need to talk to your doctor. If you see red or reddish poop in the toilet, don't be alarmed right away. First ask yourself if you've had red foods lately. Beets, Jell- O, tomato soup, and red drinks can change the color of your stool. If you don't think your diet is the cause, the red you see may be blood. And if it's bright red, the blood likely comes from the lower part of your digestive tract. Common causes include: Noncancerous tumors Cancer Inflammation in the colon, called colitis Growths called polyps in your colon Conditions caused by small sacs in the wall of the colon, called diverticular disease Hemorrhoids Call your doctor if you see red that's probably not from food you ate.", "question": "What does yellow poop mean?", "answer": ["This shade is also normal for many people.

It's more common in men than women, and more in whites than African- Americans. There's really nothing you can do to prevent leukemia. It's cancer of your blood cells caused by a rise in the number of white blood cells in your body. They crowd out the red blood cells and platelets your body needs to be healthy. All those extra white blood cells don't work right, and that causes problems. Blood has three types of cells: white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen, and platelets that help blood to clot. Every day, billions of new blood cells are made in the bone marrow -- most of them red cells. But when you have leukemia, your body makes more white cells than it needs. There are two main types of white blood cells in your body: lymphoid cells and myeloid cells. Leukemia can happen in either type. These leukemia cells can't fight infection the way normal white blood cells do. And because there are so many of them, they start to affect the way your major organs work. Eventually, there aren't enough red blood cells to supply oxygen, enough platelets to clot the blood, or enough normal white blood cells to fight infection. Along with infection, this can cause problems like anemia, bruising, and bleeding. Leukemia is grouped in two ways: How fast it develops and gets worse Which type of blood cell is involved (usually myeloid or lymphoid) These types are then put into one of two categories: acute or chronic. Acute leukemia happens when most of the abnormal blood cells stay immature and can't carry out normal functions. It can get bad very fast. Chronic leukemia happens when there are some immature cells, but others are normal and can function normally. That means it gets bad, but more slowly. No one knows exactly what causes leukemia. People who have it have certain abnormal chromosomes, but the chromosomes don't cause the leukemia. You can't really prevent leukemia, but it may be possible that certain things in your environment could trigger the development of it. For example, if you are a tobacco smoker, you are more prone to some types of leukemia than a nonsmoker. It's also associated with a high amount of radiation exposure and certain chemicals. Some kinds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy used to treat other cancers can actually cause leukemia. The chance that you'll develop leukemia depends on the types of chemotherapy drugs used. Family history is another risk factor for leukemia. For example, if an identical twin gets a certain type of leukemia, there is a 20% chance the other twin will have it within a year. The treatment you get depends on the type of leukemia you have, how far it has spread, and how healthy you are. But the main options are: Chemotherapy Radiation Biologic therapy Targeted therapy Stem cell transplant Surgery Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells in your blood and bone marrow. You can get the medicine: Through an injection into a vein or muscle As a pill Into the fluid around your spinal cord Radiation uses high-energy X-rays to kill leukemia cells or keep them from growing. You can get it in only one part of your body where there are a lot of cancer cells, or all over. Biologic therapy, also called immunotherapy, helps your immune system find and attack cancer cells. Drugs like interleukins and interferon can help boost your body's natural defenses against leukemia. Targeted therapy uses drugs to block specific genes or proteins that cancer cells need to grow. This treatment can stop the signals leukemia cells use to grow and divide, cut off their blood supply, or kill them directly. Stem cell transplant replaces the leukemia cells in your bone marrow with new ones that make blood. Your doctor can get the new stem cells from your own body or from a donor. First you'll have high doses of chemotherapy to destroy the cancer cells in your bone marrow. Then you'll get the new stem cells through an infusion into one of your veins. They will grow into new, healthy blood cells. Surgery. Your doctor can remove your spleen if it is filled with cancer cells and is pressing on nearby organs.

It's cancer of your blood cells caused by a rise in the number of white blood cells in your body. They crowd out the red blood cells and platelets your body needs to be healthy. All those extra white blood cells don't work right, and that causes problems. Blood has three types of cells: white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen, and platelets that help blood to clot. Every day, billions of new blood cells are made in the bone marrow -- most of them red cells. But when you have leukemia, your body makes more white cells than it needs. There are two main types of white blood cells in your body: lymphoid cells and myeloid cells. Leukemia can happen in either type. These leukemia cells can't fight infection the way normal white blood cells do. And because there are so many of them, they start to affect the way your major organs work. Eventually, there aren't enough red blood cells to supply oxygen, enough platelets to clot the blood, or enough normal white blood cells to fight infection. Along with infection, this can cause problems like anemia, bruising, and bleeding. Leukemia is grouped in two ways: How fast it develops and gets worse Which type of blood cell is involved (usually myeloid or lymphoid) These types are then put into one of two categories: acute or chronic. Acute leukemia happens when most of the abnormal blood cells stay immature and can't carry out normal functions. It can get bad very fast. Chronic leukemia happens when there are some immature cells, but others are normal and can function normally. That means it gets bad, but more slowly. No one knows exactly what causes leukemia.

Drugs like interleukins and interferon can help boost your body's natural defenses against leukemia. Targeted therapy uses drugs to block specific genes or proteins that cancer cells need to grow. This treatment can stop the signals leukemia cells use to grow and divide, cut off their blood supply, or kill them directly. Stem cell transplant replaces the leukemia cells in your bone marrow with new ones that make blood. Your doctor can get the new stem cells from your own body or from a donor.

Generally, the earlier you and your doctor catch it, the simpler it is to handle. The treatment you get will depend on a few things: How deep the melanoma is in your skin Whether it has spread to other parts of your body Your general health Often, the first step is to remove the tumor from your skin, usually with surgery. Your doctor or surgeon will numb your skin and cut out the melanoma, plus some extra skin around it. You'll have stitches for 1-2 weeks. If it isn't deep, a doctor who treats skin, called a dermatologist, can do the operation during a regular surgery visit, and you can go home right after. This might be all you need, especially if the cancer is only in the top layer of your skin. If the tumor has grown deep into your skin or spread to other parts of your body, treatment is more complex. You might need surgery to remove lymph nodes near the melanoma to see if the cancer has spread there. For example, if the problem is on your arm, the surgeon might take out the lymph nodes under your armpit. Other options are: Immunotherapy. This approach uses drugs that help your immune system find and attack cancer cells. You might get them in a shot or go to a treatment center or hospital to get them through an IV every 2-4 weeks. If the melanoma is on your face, your doctor might prescribe a cream that revs up the immune cells only around the tumor, instead of in your whole body like the other drugs. Sometimes, immunotherapy drugs can make your body attack your healthy organs. If that happens, you'll need to stop taking them and get other treatment to stop the attack. Chemotherapy. These drugs travel through your body and attack cancer cells. Some chemotherapy drugs are pills, and others you get through an IV. Targeted therapy. Cancer happens when cells grow and divide too fast or don't die when they should. This can happen because of bad genes inside the cells. In targeted therapy, drugs go after changes in melanoma cells that make them grow out of control. This treatment tends to stop working well after a while. If that happens, you and your doctor will need to try another approach. Radiation. A specialist will zap the area with high-energy rays, which kill cancer cells. It's like getting an X-ray, but the dose is stronger. Clinical trials. Scientists are working on finding new treatments for melanoma. But they have to test them and compare how they work to current therapies before they become available for everyone. They do this in research studies called clinical trials. Your doctor might know if you can sign up for one. If you're accepted, you could get either a regular treatment that's already available or the one that scientists are testing.

What about your heart? Research shows that some of them may help lower cholesterol, improve blood pressure, and other things that put you at risk for heart disease. It's unclear, though, if they help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other problems. Here are six nutrients that can be a good addition to your heart-healthy lifestyle. Fiber. Found naturally in fruits, grains, vegetables, and legumes, fiber cuts down the amount of cholesterol your body soaks up from food. Try to get at least 25 to 30 grams of it every day. Men less than age 51 should aim for 38 grams a day. It's best to get your daily dose from your diet, but supplements are another option. There's good evidence that blond psyllium husk -- common in fiber supplements -- can lower âbadâ LDL cholesterol. It can also raise the âgoodâ kind, HDL. Other fiber supplements include methylcellulose, wheat dextrin, and calcium polycarbophil.. If you take a fiber supplement, increase the amount you take slowly. This can help prevent gas and cramping. It's also important to drink enough liquids when you increase your fiber intake. Sterols and stanols. Find these in foods like nuts and grains, or you can buy them as supplements. They reduce the amount of cholesterol that your body absorbs from food. They're also added to many foods, such as some margarines, orange juice, and yogurts. Experts recommend 2 grams a day to help lower LDL cholesterol for people who have high cholesterol. Coenzyme Q10 ( Co Q10 ). Your body naturally makes small amounts of this enzyme, also known as ubiquinone and ubiquinol. As a supplement, Co Q10 may help lower blood pressure, either on its own or along with medications. Other studies have found that adding it to heart failure drugs may help people feel better day to day. Co Q10 pills are also popular as a treatment for the side effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins. Why? These meds can sometimes lower the amount of Co Q10 the body makes on its own. Some doctors suggest adding a Co Q10 supplement to make up for the loss, hoping it will relieve problems like muscle pain and weakness. But study results have been mixed. Fish oil . Full of omega-3 fatty acids, it can slash levels of triglycerides -- an unhealthy fat in your blood -- by up to 30%. It may also improve blood pressure. But it's not clear if non-prescription fish oil supplements lower your risk of heart attack and stroke. Your best bet may be to eat fish with omega-3 fatty acids. The American Heart Association recommends that all adults eat at least two 3.5-ounce servings of fish a week. Garlic. Not only does it make just about anything taste delicious, it could also slightly lower blood pressure. It may slow the buildup of plaque in your arteries, lowering your risk of blood clots. Research shows that both garlic in food and in supplements may help. Green tea . Research shows that both the extract and the drink may lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and raise HDL levels. Don't take a supplement just because it's labeled \"heart healthy.\" Not all of them are guaranteed to help you, and it can be dangerous to get too much of some of them. Pay attention to what the supplement does, and make sure you really need it. Ask your doctor which product is most likely to help. If you have a heart condition or for a high risk for a heart attack, you must follow your doctor's advice.

They can also get into your blood. More than 20 types of candida (yeast) normally live in your GI tract, on your skin, and in your mucus membranes without causing any problems. Their growth is kept in check by bacteria. But when something happens to kill off the bacteria or change the conditions where yeast lives, it can multiply and cause mild to serious infections. This article touches on the most common causes. Antibiotics. If you use broad-spectrum antibiotics like tetracycline or amoxicillin to fight off another infection, these antibiotics can also kill off the healthy bacteria that keep the yeast in check. Corticosteroids. The use of inhaled corticosteroids for asthma is linked to oral candidiasis (thrush), a yeast infection in your mouth. People who wear dentures, particularly those who also have diabetes, may be more likely to get thrush. Clean your dentures thoroughly each night to prevent infection. Some products can change the acidity level in your vagina. That encourages the growth of yeast and can remove the helpful bacteria that keep yeast at bay. The change in estrogen and progesterone levels in women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, using hormone replacement therapy, or taking birth control with estrogen can lead to vaginal yeast infections. Wearing underwear (or tight jeans or a wet swimsuit) that doesn't breathe can increase body heat and moisture in the vagina. This creates conditions yeast likes to grow in. Choose underwear with a cotton crotch, and change out of swimsuits and workout clothes as soon as possible. Change babies' diapers often. Soiled and wet diapers can lead to diaper rash. Once the skin is irritated, a yeast infection can set in. Diabetes. If your diabetes isn't well-controlled, the increase in sugar in the mucus membranes (moist tissues) of your vagina can create a fertile environment yeast to grow. Weakened immune system. If you have HIV/ AIDS or another condition that hampers your immune system, your body can't fight off infections as well.

There's not a lot of research on whether that's truth or hype, but there are reasons to think it might be another tool for your toolkit. Coconut oil comes from the fruit -- white part -- of a coconut. You can cook and bake with it. And many people use it on their hair and nails as a natural beauty product. It has two forms: refined and unrefined or virgin. Refined coconut oil comes from dried coconut. The oil is taken out under high heat and then goes through a bleaching and deodorizing process. It doesn't smell like coconut -- it has a neutral odor. In the kitchen, you can use it for sautÃ©ing, stir-frying, and baking. Unrefined coconut oil comes from fresh coconut fruit. The process doesn't involve high temperatures, which is why you might see it called \"cold-pressed.\" Virgin coconut oil smells like coconuts. You can use it to bake and cook, just like refined coconut oil, but it's best for dishes cooked at lower temperatures. Virgin cold-pressed coconut oil ( VCO) is the kind experts think has the most health benefits, both as part of your diet and for your skin. Because VCO isn't processed with high heat, it keeps more of its germ-fighting power than refined coconut oil. It can: Moisturize Help with inflammation Kill bacteria When you put VCO on your skin, it can help hold in moisture, ease redness and swelling, and keep certain bacteria from growing. Studies show VCO can help with symptoms of eczema (atopic dermatitis), a skin condition that looks a lot like psoriasis. Eczema and psoriasis share many of the same symptoms and even have some of the same triggers. Psoriasis scales tend to be thicker than patches of eczema, but both need moisturizing treatment to help with dryness, scaling, and itching. So even though they're different conditions, VCO can help with both. While it may be a good add-on to your psoriasis treatment plan, coconut oil isn't a stand-alone solution. For psoriasis medications like steroids to work well, it's best to soften the hard scales so the meds can get to the skin below. Coconut oil can help soften and loosen the scales first. Scalp psoriasis tends to have the hardest scales because your hair traps them in place and they're not easy to see or treat. They can get bigger and tougher over time. Here's how to use coconut oil to help with the scales on your scalp: Spread the oil over your scalp, focusing on scaly areas. Gently massage the oil into the scales. Wrap your scalp in a towel or shower cap. Leave it on for 30 to 60 minutes, or overnight. Wash your hair and scalp with normal, anti-dandruff, or tar shampoo. After treating with VCO, it should be easier to loosen and remove some scales gently. Do it while your scalp is still damp and the scales are the softest and loose. Then: Put a plastic comb flat against the scale and gently rub it in a circle. As the scale loosens, try to comb it out of your hair. Wash your hair to remove any leftover scales. Don't pull too hard or too quickly. Doing so can hurt your skin, cause bleeding, or make you lose hair.

It doesn't smell like coconut -- it has a neutral odor. In the kitchen, you can use it for sautÃ©ing, stir-frying, and baking. Unrefined coconut oil comes from fresh coconut fruit. The process doesn't involve high temperatures, which is why you might see it called \"cold-pressed.\" Virgin coconut oil smells like coconuts. You can use it to bake and cook, just like refined coconut oil, but it's best for dishes cooked at lower temperatures. Virgin cold-pressed coconut oil ( VCO) is the kind experts think has the most health benefits, both as part of your diet and for your skin. Because VCO isn't processed with high heat, it keeps more of its germ-fighting power than refined coconut oil. It can: Moisturize Help with inflammation Kill bacteria When you put VCO on your skin, it can help hold in moisture, ease redness and swelling, and keep certain bacteria from growing. Studies show VCO can help with symptoms of eczema (atopic dermatitis), a skin condition that looks a lot like psoriasis. Eczema and psoriasis share many of the same symptoms and even have some of the same triggers. Psoriasis scales tend to be thicker than patches of eczema, but both need moisturizing treatment to help with dryness, scaling, and itching. So even though they're different conditions, VCO can help with both. While it may be a good add-on to your psoriasis treatment plan, coconut oil isn't a stand-alone solution. For psoriasis medications like steroids to work well, it's best to soften the hard scales so the meds can get to the skin below. Coconut oil can help soften and loosen the scales first. Scalp psoriasis tends to have the hardest scales because your hair traps them in place and they're not easy to see or treat. They can get bigger and tougher over time. Here's how to use coconut oil to help with the scales on your scalp: Spread the oil over your scalp, focusing on scaly areas. Gently massage the oil into the scales. Wrap your scalp in a towel or shower cap. Leave it on for 30 to 60 minutes, or overnight. Wash your hair and scalp with normal, anti-dandruff, or tar shampoo. After treating with VCO, it should be easier to loosen and remove some scales gently. Do it while your scalp is still damp and the scales are the softest and loose. Then: Put a plastic comb flat against the scale and gently rub it in a circle. As the scale loosens, try to comb it out of your hair. Wash your hair to remove any leftover scales. Don't pull too hard or too quickly. Doing so can hurt your skin, cause bleeding, or make you lose hair. After you've taken the scaly layer off, apply your prescription treatment.", "question": "Are there different types of coconut oil?", "answer": ["It has two forms: refined and unrefined or virgin.

There are several different types, causes, and treatments. With this type, urine leaks due to weakened pelvic floor muscles and tissues. It can happen when pressure on your bladder increases -- such as when you exercise, laugh, sneeze, or cough. Pregnancy and childbirth can stretch and weaken a woman's pelvic floor muscles. Other things that can lead to stress incontinence are being overweight or obese, taking certain medications or, in men, having prostate surgery. This is also called overactive bladder ( OAB). With this type, you have an urgent need to go to the bathroom and may not get there in time. Causes of overactive bladder include: Damage to the bladder's nerves Damage to other parts of the nervous system Damage to muscles Aging Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and stroke can affect nerves, leading to urge incontinence. Bladder problems, such as infections and bladder stones, and certain medications can also cause it. If you can't empty your bladder, you may have overflow incontinence.

One procedure pulls the bladder (urethra) back up to a more normal position, relieving the pressure and leakage.

Doctors sometimes prescribe medicines (or inject Botox in the bladder) that block the contractions of an overactive bladder. Electrical stimulation of the bladder nerves helps in some cases. Surgery is reserved for severe cases. It aims to increase the amount of urine your bladder can store. For overflow incontinence, treatments include: Pads. Medication or surgery.

There are several different types, causes, and treatments. With this type, urine leaks due to weakened pelvic floor muscles and tissues. It can happen when pressure on your bladder increases -- such as when you exercise, laugh, sneeze, or cough. Pregnancy and childbirth can stretch and weaken a woman's pelvic floor muscles. Other things that can lead to stress incontinence are being overweight or obese, taking certain medications or, in men, having prostate surgery. This is also called overactive bladder ( OAB). With this type, you have an urgent need to go to the bathroom and may not get there in time. Causes of overactive bladder include: Damage to the bladder's nerves Damage to other parts of the nervous system Damage to muscles Aging Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and stroke can affect nerves, leading to urge incontinence. Bladder problems, such as infections and bladder stones, and certain medications can also cause it. If you can't empty your bladder, you may have overflow incontinence. This means you may dribble urine. Causes include: Weak bladder muscles Nerve damage Conditions that block the flow of urine, such as tumors or an enlarged prostate Constipation Certain medications You need to get the condition treated. If your bladder can't empty, that can lead to infections and other problems. Mental or physical problems such as dementia or arthritis prevent you from getting to the bathroom in time. This means you have any two types of the condition. Many women have both stress and urge incontinence. Lifestyle changes and treatments can help with symptoms. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan that's right for you. For stress incontinence, treatments include: Pads and Vaginal Inserts. Pelvic floor exercises. If you've had a baby, chances are you've been told to do Kegel exercises. These help to strengthen the pelvic floor after childbirth. They also help prevent stress incontinence. Best of all, you can do Kegels anytime, anywhere. Here's how: Squeeze the muscles that you use stop the flow of urine. Hold the squeeze for 10 seconds, then rest for 10 seconds. Do 3 or 4 sets daily. Note: You can learn how to do Kegels by stopping your urine, but don't do this routinely. Stopping the flow of urine can lead to an infection. Biofeedback . A probe is inserted to monitor when your bladder muscles squeeze. When you're able to recognize it as it's happening, you can start to gain control of it. It's often used in combination with Kegel exercises. Pessary. For women, doctors may prescribe a device called a pessary that is inserted into the vagina. It repositions the urethra to help reduce leakage. Injections and surgery. Shots to bulk up your urethral area may help. In more extreme cases, you may need surgery. One procedure pulls the bladder (urethra) back up to a more normal position, relieving the pressure and leakage. Another surgery involves securing the bladder (urethra) with a \"sling,\" a piece of material that holds up the bladder to prevent leakage. For urge incontinence, treatment options include: Timed voiding and bladder training. First, you complete a chart of the times you pee and the times you leak. You observe patterns and then plan to empty your bladder before an accident would happen. You can also \"retrain\" your bladder, gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits. Kegel exercises are also helpful. Medications, electrical stimulation, or surgery. Doctors sometimes prescribe medicines (or inject Botox in the bladder) that block the contractions of an overactive bladder. Electrical stimulation of the bladder nerves helps in some cases. Surgery is reserved for severe cases. It aims to increase the amount of urine your bladder can store. For overflow incontinence, treatments include: Pads. Medication or surgery. Meds called alpha-blockers often can help if the problem is caused by an enlarged prostate. If there's a blockage, you may need surgery. Catheter. Some people use a catheter to make sure their bladder is emptied. It's a thin plastic tube that you insert in your urethra. A doctor or nurse can teach you how to insert it for yourself. It's important to identify any underlying disease or blockage causing overflow incontinence and treat that. You might feel embarrassed to talk about your urinary incontinence, but it's worth it.

In most cases, the procedure takes 45 to 60 minutes, during which several dozen images may be taken. Personal items such as your watch, wallet (including any credit cards with magnetic strips - should not be brought into the room with the MRI machine in it. The credit cards will be erased by the magnet), and jewelry should be left at home or removed prior to the MRI scan. Secured lockers should be available to store personal items. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown during the MRI scan. As the MRI scan begins, you will hear the equipment making a muffled thumping sound, which will last for several minutes. Other than the sound, you should notice no unusual sensations during the scanning. Certain MRI exams require an injection of a dye (contrast material). This helps identify certain anatomic structures on the scan images. Before the exam, feel free to ask questions and tell the technician or doctor if you have any concerns. People who get anxious when in tight spaces (claustrophobic) may benefit from talking to their doctor before the procedure. Some options include taking a prescription medication before the procedure to relieve anxiety or having the exam done in one of the newer and less confining MRI units, called an open MRI, when available.

Is that why the MRI is considered a preventive health measure?  Yes. MRIs are considered preventive because they can help predict, stop or even reverse some of the more aggressive disease of advanced prostate cancer. They can also tell doctors to look for prostate cancer and other conditions, such as pelvic pain that may be related to cancer. MRIs can help detect some common forms of prostate cancer as well. Although prostate cancer can be detected with a CT scan, it is more commonly detected with MRIs. How frequently is an MRI recommended? The recommendation is one every three years or more often as needed. What is the recommended timeframe for treatment? The recommendation is to eliminate a condition from a patient's life as quickly as possible, and then have the condition controlled if treatment is needed. What happens if the cancer continues after an MRI scan or surgery? Most types of cancer are found in the lymph nodes or nodes in the pelvis. After treatment, the tissue in the prostate is removed. This is called the prostatic-site surgery. The prostate is removed to stop the growth of the cancer.

Here's a look at how your levels affect your health. They're less than 100 mg/d L after not eating (fasting) for at least 8 hours. And they're less than 140 mg/d L 2 hours after eating. During the day, levels tend to be at their lowest just before meals. For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/d L. For some people, 60 is normal; for others, 90. What's a low sugar level? It varies widely, too. Many people's glucose won't ever fall below 60, even with prolonged fasting. When you diet or fast, the liver keeps your levels normal by turning fat and muscle into sugar. A few people's levels may fall somewhat lower. Doctors use these tests to find out if you have diabetes: Fasting plasma glucose test. The doctor tests your blood sugar levels after fasting for 8 hours and it's higher than 126 mg/d L.

Electrocardiogram ( EKG): This records the electrical activity of your heart. Chest X-ray: It will let your doctor know if you have an enlarged heart. It can also show congestion. Echocardiogram: This uses sound waves to make a video image of your heart. Exercise test: You may hear this called a stress test. It measures how your heart responds when it has to work hard. Heart catheterization: In this test, you get dye injected through a small tube into a blood vessel. It will show any blockages or weakened arteries. Many of the causes of high-output heart failure are curable. It's a good idea to treat the underlying cause first. Your doctor may suggest other treatments, including a diet low in salt and water.

Explain. Children typically communicate with others using play and communication. In order to use play, children need to have their hands free from activity and their face up. A face up face in a play situation communicates that the child is comfortable and relaxed with being alone. In order to use communication, children need to feel that their bodies are supported. A child's shoulders are raised to communicate a good mood. A child's arms are extended to support and comfort the child. The child's head is supported to communicate that they are relaxed and comfortable. Sometimes, the child's body language and head movement can indicate if the child has reached their cognitive milestones and wants to continue to progress.\n\nWhat is an infant's head up?  head up indicates that they are calm, relaxed, and interested in their surroundings. It can also indicate that the child wants to interact with others.

A specific phobia, formerly called a simple phobia, is a lasting and unreasonable fear caused by the presence or thought of a specific object or situation that usually poses little or no actual danger. Exposure to the object or situation brings about an immediate reaction, causing the person to endure intense anxiety (nervousness) or to avoid the object or situation entirely. The distress associated with the phobia and/or the need to avoid the object or situation can significantly interfere with the person's ability to function. Adults with a specific phobia recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable, yet are unable to overcome it. There are different types of specific phobias, based on the object or situation feared, including: Animal phobias: Examples include the fear of dogs, snakes, insects, or mice. Animal phobias are the most common specific phobias. Situational phobias: These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator. Natural environment phobias: Examples include the fear of storms, heights, or water. Blood-injection-injury phobias: These involve a fear of being injured, of seeing blood or of invasive medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections Other phobias: These include a fear of falling down, a fear of loud sounds, and a fear of costumed characters, such as clowns. A person can have more than one specific phobia. Symptoms of specific phobias may include: Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart, nausea or diarrhea, sweating, trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking Anticipatory anxiety, which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia; for example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because he or she may see a dog along the way. Children with a specific phobia may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that about 5%-12% of Americans have phobias. Specific phobias affect an estimated 6.3 million adult Americans. Phobias usually first appear in adolescence and adulthood, but can occur in people of all ages. They are slightly more common in women than in men. Specific phobias in children are common and usually disappear over time. Specific phobias in adults generally start suddenly and are more lasting than childhood phobias. Only about 20% of specific phobias in adults go away on their own (without treatment). The exact cause of specific phobias is not known, but most appear to be associated with a traumatic experience or a learned reaction. For example, a person who has a frightening or threatening experience with an animal, such as an attack or being bitten, can develop a specific phobia. Witnessing a traumatic event in which others experience harm or extreme fear can also cause a specific phobia, as can receiving information or repeated warnings about potentially dangerous situations or animals. Fear can be learned from others, as well. A child whose parents react with fear and anxiety to certain objects or situations is likely to also respond to those objects with fear. If symptoms of a specific phobia are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a medical and psychiatric history and may perform a brief physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose specific phobias, the doctor may use various tests to make sure that a physical illness isn't the cause of the symptoms. If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use clinical interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a specific phobia. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis of specific phobias on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. A specific phobia is diagnosed if the person's fear and anxiety are particularly distressing or if they interfere with his or her daily routine, including school, work, social activities, and relationships. Treatment for specific phobias may include one or a combination of: Cognitive behavioral therapy : Psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for specific phobias. Treatment usually involves a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called systematic desensitization or exposure and response prevention ( ERP) therapy, in which patients are gradually exposed to what frightens them until their fear begins to fade. Medication : For situational phobias that produce intense, temporary anxiety (for example, a fear of flying), short-acting sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) such as Ativan, or Xanax may be prescribed on an occasional, as-needed basis to help reduce anticipatory anxiety. Unless a phobia is accompanied by other conditions such as depression or panic disorder, long-term or daily medicines are generally not used. Occasionally, serotonergic antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac or Lexapromay have potential value for some patients. More recently, common blood pressure drugs called beta-blockers have been used to treat anxiety related to specific phobias. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, may also help reduce anxiety symptoms. For most people, specific phobias can be successfully treated with therapy, medication, or a combination of both. Although many specific phobias cannot be prevented, early intervention and treatment following a traumatic experience, such as an animal attack, may prevent the person from developing a severe anxiety disorder.", "question": "What are situational phobias?", "answer": ["Situational phobias: These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator."], "generated_answer": "phobias are general anxieties that can result from the mind's reaction to a stimulus or the perception of a stimulus.

A specific phobia, formerly called a simple phobia, is a lasting and unreasonable fear caused by the presence or thought of a specific object or situation that usually poses little or no actual danger. Exposure to the object or situation brings about an immediate reaction, causing the person to endure intense anxiety (nervousness) or to avoid the object or situation entirely. The distress associated with the phobia and/or the need to avoid the object or situation can significantly interfere with the person's ability to function. Adults with a specific phobia recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable, yet are unable to overcome it. There are different types of specific phobias, based on the object or situation feared, including: Animal phobias: Examples include the fear of dogs, snakes, insects, or mice. Animal phobias are the most common specific phobias. Situational phobias: These involve a fear of specific situations, such as flying, riding in a car or on public transportation, driving, going over bridges or in tunnels, or of being in a closed-in place, like an elevator. Natural environment phobias: Examples include the fear of storms, heights, or water. Blood-injection-injury phobias: These involve a fear of being injured, of seeing blood or of invasive medical procedures, such as blood tests or injections Other phobias: These include a fear of falling down, a fear of loud sounds, and a fear of costumed characters, such as clowns. A person can have more than one specific phobia. Symptoms of specific phobias may include: Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart, nausea or diarrhea, sweating, trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking Anticipatory anxiety, which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia; for example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because he or she may see a dog along the way. Children with a specific phobia may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that about 5%-12% of Americans have phobias. Specific phobias affect an estimated 6.3 million adult Americans. Phobias usually first appear in adolescence and adulthood, but can occur in people of all ages. They are slightly more common in women than in men. Specific phobias in children are common and usually disappear over time. Specific phobias in adults generally start suddenly and are more lasting than childhood phobias. Only about 20% of specific phobias in adults go away on their own (without treatment). The exact cause of specific phobias is not known, but most appear to be associated with a traumatic experience or a learned reaction. For example, a person who has a frightening or threatening experience with an animal, such as an attack or being bitten, can develop a specific phobia. Witnessing a traumatic event in which others experience harm or extreme fear can also cause a specific phobia, as can receiving information or repeated warnings about potentially dangerous situations or animals. Fear can be learned from others, as well. A child whose parents react with fear and anxiety to certain objects or situations is likely to also respond to those objects with fear. If symptoms of a specific phobia are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a medical and psychiatric history and may perform a brief physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose specific phobias, the doctor may use various tests to make sure that a physical illness isn't the cause of the symptoms. If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use clinical interviews and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a specific phobia. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis of specific phobias on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. A specific phobia is diagnosed if the person's fear and anxiety are particularly distressing or if they interfere with his or her daily routine, including school, work, social activities, and relationships. Treatment for specific phobias may include one or a combination of: Cognitive behavioral therapy : Psychotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for specific phobias. Treatment usually involves a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called systematic desensitization or exposure and response prevention ( ERP) therapy, in which patients are gradually exposed to what frightens them until their fear begins to fade. Medication : For situational phobias that produce intense, temporary anxiety (for example, a fear of flying), short-acting sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) such as Ativan, or Xanax may be prescribed on an occasional, as-needed basis to help reduce anticipatory anxiety. Unless a phobia is accompanied by other conditions such as depression or panic disorder, long-term or daily medicines are generally not used. Occasionally, serotonergic antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac or Lexapromay have potential value for some patients. More recently, common blood pressure drugs called beta-blockers have been used to treat anxiety related to specific phobias. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, may also help reduce anxiety symptoms. For most people, specific phobias can be successfully treated with therapy, medication, or a combination of both. Although many specific phobias cannot be prevented, early intervention and treatment following a traumatic experience, such as an animal attack, may prevent the person from developing a severe anxiety disorder.", "question": "What are natural environment phobias?", "answer": ["Natural environment phobias: Examples include the fear of storms, heights, or water."], "generated_answer": "  are short-lived diseases that occur when plants, animals or fungi are disturbed.    phobia.   has occurred.  one of the symptoms is loss of balance and coordination. itis in a major central nervous system tumor.\nThis doesn't seem very good news!

While genes and life stress may contribute to it, experts believe that symptoms may arise from a problem with nerve circuits and areas in the brain that control emotion, thinking, and behavior. The best treatment for bipolar disorder is often a combination of medication and counseling. Other treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) are often successful for people with very severe symptoms who don't respond to traditional therapy or who can't take the medications. Doctors sometimes treat the mania symptoms of bipolar disorder with one set of drugs and the depression symptoms with another, although some mood-stabilizing drugs are effective at treating both kinds of symptoms. Certain drugs are also used for \"maintenance\" to maintain a steady mood. Antidepressants are usually not used alone because they sometimes cause manic attacks in depressed patients, and they may be less effective for treating bipolar than unipolar depression. Many people respond well to medications for bipolar disorder. For many others, the symptoms do not completely disappear despite therapy. The mood symptoms may become less intense and more manageable, however. Remember, getting your diagnosis should come as a relief. Now you know what the problem has been and you're on the road to getting the right treatment. If you are suffering from bipolar mania, your doctor at first may treat you with an anti-manic mood stabilizer and sometimes also an antipsychotic drug and/or a benzodiazepine to quickly control hyperactivity, sleeplessness, hostility, and irritability. Mood stabilizers treat manias or depressions without causing symptoms to swing the other way. Some also may help to reduce the risk of suicide. They are usually taken for a long time, commonly for many years. Examples include lithium and certain anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine ( Tegretol), lamotrigine ( Lamictal) or valproate ( Depakote). Atypical antipsychotics used to treat mania include aripiprazole ( Abilify), asenapine ( Saphris), cariprazine ( Vryalar), olanzapine ( Zyprexa), quetiapine ( Seroquel), risperidone ( Risperdal), and ziprasidone ( Geodon) . Treating bipolar mania often requires hospitalization because there is high risk for unpredictable, reckless behavior and noncompliance with treatment. For people with extreme mania, pregnant women with mania, or those people whose mania can't be controlled with mood stabilizers, doctors sometimes also recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). If mania occurs while you are on maintenance therapy, your doctor may simply change your medication dose. Or you may start taking an antipsychotic drug or a second mood stabilizer to lessen symptoms. Also antidepressants should usually be discontinued while someone is manic, because they can worsen the symptoms of mania. Non-drug treatments, such as psychotherapy and establishing a well-ordered routine, may help patients in their maintenance phase. This is often suggested along with medication, but non-drug treatments are usually not effective alone. Treating bipolar depression is controversial and challenging. Studies have shown that antidepressants may be less effective in treating bipolar depression than they are in treating unipolar depression (that is, major depressive episodes in someone who has never had a previous manic or hypomanic episode). Also using antidepressants alone may trigger a manic or hypomanic episode in some people with bipolar disorder. Antidepressants alone also may lead to or prolong rapid cycling. In rapid cycling, a person may recover more quickly from depression but then experience mania followed by another episode of depression. And antidepressants can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts in children and adolescents with any form of depression. Three drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of bipolar depression: quetiapine ( Seroquel) by itself, olanzapine ( Zyprexa) when used with fluoxetine ( Prozac) (which also comes as a combination pill called Symbyax), and lurasidone ( Latuda) used alone or with lithium or valproate ( Depakote). The atypical antipsychotic drug caripirazine ( Vraylar) has also shown promise in initial studies to treat bipolar depression. There are also a number of treatments that have begun to show promise in research studies for treating bipolar depression, including the Parkinson's disease drug pramipexole dihydrochloride ( Mirapex), the wakefulness drugs modafinil ( Provigil) and armodinifinil ( Nuvigil), the nutritional supplement n-acetylcysteine, and the intravenous anesthetic drug ketamine. In April 2002, the American Psychiatric Association suggested using lithium or the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine ( Lamictal) as an initial treatment for people in the acute depressive phase of bipolar disorder who were not already taking a mood-stabilizing drug. Since then, research has shown that Lamictal seems to be more effective at preventing future depression rather than treating current depression in bipolar disorder. Recent studies have shown that Lamictal added to lithium may be a potent treatment for acute bipolar depression. For depressed bipolar patients who don't respond to mood stabilizers alone, or to FDA-approved medications for bipolar depression, doctors sometimes prescribe a mood stabilizer plus a traditional antidepressant -- often either buproprion ( Wellbutrin) or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) such as fluoxetine ( Prozac) or sertraline ( Zoloft), although the effectiveness of antidepressants has not been proven for bipolar depression. If all else fails, or if symptoms are especially severe, doctors may recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). It helps nearly 75% of the patients who are given this treatment. Two treatments called vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r TMS) are also being studied as a treatment for bipolar depression. In addition, psychotherapy may be beneficial when added to drug treatment. Once depression has resolved, mood stabilizers are the best-proven treatments to prevent either future depression or manias. If psychotic symptoms occur during an acute depressive episode, the doctor may recommend antipsychotic medicine.

Three drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of bipolar depression: quetiapine ( Seroquel) by itself, olanzapine ( Zyprexa) when used with fluoxetine ( Prozac) (which also comes as a combination pill called Symbyax), and lurasidone ( Latuda) used alone or with lithium or valproate ( Depakote). The atypical antipsychotic drug caripirazine ( Vraylar) has also shown promise in initial studies to treat bipolar depression. There are also a number of treatments that have begun to show promise in research studies for treating bipolar depression, including the Parkinson's disease drug pramipexole dihydrochloride ( Mirapex), the wakefulness drugs modafinil ( Provigil) and armodinifinil ( Nuvigil), the nutritional supplement n-acetylcysteine, and the intravenous anesthetic drug ketamine. In April 2002, the American Psychiatric Association suggested using lithium or the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine ( Lamictal) as an initial treatment for people in the acute depressive phase of bipolar disorder who were not already taking a mood-stabilizing drug. Since then, research has shown that Lamictal seems to be more effective at preventing future depression rather than treating current depression in bipolar disorder. Recent studies have shown that Lamictal added to lithium may be a potent treatment for acute bipolar depression. For depressed bipolar patients who don't respond to mood stabilizers alone, or to FDA-approved medications for bipolar depression, doctors sometimes prescribe a mood stabilizer plus a traditional antidepressant -- often either buproprion ( Wellbutrin) or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) such as fluoxetine ( Prozac) or sertraline ( Zoloft), although the effectiveness of antidepressants has not been proven for bipolar depression. If all else fails, or if symptoms are especially severe, doctors may recommend electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT). It helps nearly 75% of the patients who are given this treatment. Two treatments called vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r TMS) are also being studied as a treatment for bipolar depression. In addition, psychotherapy may be beneficial when added to drug treatment. Once depression has resolved, mood stabilizers are the best-proven treatments to prevent either future depression or manias. If psychotic symptoms occur during an acute depressive episode, the doctor may recommend antipsychotic medicine.

That full range of motion lets you make different sounds when you speak. It also helps you swallow and sweep away bits of food to keep your mouth clean. But for babies with tongue-tie, there's a problem with something called the lingual frenulum. That's the small stretch of tissue that connects the underside of your tongue to the bottom of your mouth. It might be too short and tight, or attached way up near the tip of the tongue. Either way, it ties the tongue in place. For some, it's not much of an issue. For others, it can lead to problems breastfeeding. Later on, it can affect eating and speaking. Doctors don't always check for it, and it's not always easy to notice. But even if your child's pediatrician doesn't find it until later, it can be treated. Usually, the lingual frenulum separates from the tongue before your baby is born. But sometimes it doesn't. Doctors aren't sure why. It may run in families. We do know that boys are 3 times more likely to get it than girls. It's often found because of problems breastfeeding. You may notice your baby: Can't latch well Tends to chew more than suck Doesn't gain weight the way you'd expect Feeds for a long time, takes a short break, then feeds for another long stretch Is fussy when trying to feed Makes a clicking sound while feeding Seems hungry all the time Along with symptoms, you may hurt during and after breastfeeding. You may also have sore or cracked nipples. But tongue-tie isn't the only reason there may be breastfeeding problems. So if you're having them, talk to your doctor. You might also notice your baby's tongue: Can't move far from side to side Can't reach the upper gums or roof of the mouth Can't stick out past the gums Has a V shape or heart shape at its tip when it's sticking out A physical exam is all it takes to see what's going on. The doctor will: Ask how feeding is going Check your child's tongue, mouth, and teeth Use a tongue depressor, which is like a big popsicle stick, to look under your child's tongue and check the range of motion The doctor may ask older kids to move their tongue around and make certain sounds, like of an r or l. Not all doctors agree on this. Some say to take care of it right away to ward off any issues. Others think it's better to wait. That's because it might not cause any problems or may loosen up over time. There's no way to know for sure what'll happen. If it's not treated, it can also lead to: Dental problems like tooth decay, swollen and irritated gums, and a gap between the lower two front teeth Gagging or choking on foods as your child starts to eat solids A hard time with basic things, like licking an ice cream cone and kissing Trouble saying d, l, n, r, s, t, th, and z sounds. Rolling an r can be especially hard. Talk it through with your doctor to learn what's best for you and your baby. There are two ways to take care of tongue-tie: Frenotomy: This basic procedure happens in a doctor's office. Sometimes you don't even need numbing drugs. The doctor takes a pair of specially cleaned scissors and clips the frenulum, which doesn't have many nerves or blood vessels. That means there's not much pain. And if there's any blood at all, it's a drop or two at most. Your baby can breastfeed right away, which can be soothing and healing. Frenuloplasty. When the frenulum is too thick for a quick snip, your pediatrician will choose this option. The doctor will: Give your child drugs so they sleep through the whole thing Use special tools to cut the frenulum Put in a few stitches that dissolve on their own as the wound heals Some hospitals may use a laser instead. In that case, your child won't need stitches. Both are usually very successful and prevent any speech, dental, or eating problems. It's rare for either one to cause any issues. As with any medical procedure though, there are risks, such as: Bleeding Damage to the tongue or the glands that make saliva Infection A frenuloplasty can also lead to scarring.

If you've got pain and swelling in your joints, it could be a sign of either disease. Your doctor can set you straight, but there are some key ways to tell them apart. Lupus affects everybody differently. The way you feel may not be the same as your friend who also has the disease. Most folks will get flares, which means the condition gets worse at certain times and then gets better. The symptoms can come on slowly or suddenly, and can be permanent or temporary. Some things you may notice if you have lupus are: A rash shaped like a butterfly that covers your nose and cheeks You feel tired Pain, stiffness, or swelling in your joints Fever Sensitivity to sun or light that causes skin lesions White or blue color in your fingers and toes when you're in the cold or feel stressed Headaches or chest pain Ulcers in your mouth or nose Hair loss Low numbers of blood cells (anemia) Swelling in your hands, feet, or legs Like lupus, your symptoms sometimes get better and sometimes flare up. You may get tired and have pain, swelling, and warmth in your joints. If you have psoriatic arthritis you may get problems like: Severe swelling in your fingers or toes Foot pain, often at the bottom or the heel Pain in your lower back Scaly patches on your skin that flake Pitted or discolored nails It starts when your immune system -- your body's defense against germs -- attacks your own organs and tissues. The disease causes inflammation and can affect different parts of your body, including your heart, skin, brain, and blood cells. Experts don't know the exact cause of lupus. They think it may be related to genes that put you at risk for lupus and things you come into contact with that trigger the disease. Some of those triggers are: Sunlight Infections Medications like blood pressure or anti-seizure drugs Psoriatic arthritis can happen if you have psoriasis, a condition that causes your skin to get red patches and silvery scales. Sometimes people get psoriasis first and then have psoriatic arthritis later, but others get the arthritis symptoms first. Like lupus, psoriatic arthritis happens when your immune system attacks your healthy cells and tissues. This causes your joints to get inflamed and your skin to make too many cells. It's not clear what causes the immune system to attack your body when you have psoriatic arthritis, but just like lupus, it's likely that genes and triggers play a role. There's no single test that shows you have lupus. Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you to get some blood and urine tests that give clues about your condition. He may also suggest you get a chest X-ray to look for fluid or inflammation in your lungs or an echocardiogram to see if you have problems with your heart. Your doctor may say you have lupus if you have at least four of 11 signs of the disease that are laid out by experts at the American College of Rheumatology: Butterfly-shaped rash Raised red patches on your skin You're sensitive to light Ulcers in your mouth or nose Arthritis in two or more joints, plus swelling or tenderness Inflammation in the lining of your heart or lungs Seizures or other nerve problems Too much protein in your urine Low blood cell counts Certain antibodies in your blood Results from a blood test called an ANA test that suggest you may have too many \"antinuclear\" antibodies, which could be a sign of lupus To check if you have psoriatic arthritis, you may need to get certain tests like X-rays to look at changes in your bones or joints, and blood tests that check for inflammation. Your doctor may also do a physical exam to see if you have inflammation and swelling in your joints or signs of psoriasis on your skin and nails. He will ask you about your medical history. Your doctor will probably rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. For example, if you only have swelling and pain in a single joint, you may have gout. And if you have no swelling, or very little, you could have osteoarthritis. Whether you have lupus or psoriatic arthritis, work with your doctor to find the right treatments for you.

Not only does sleep give your body time to rest and recharge, it may also be crucial to your brain's ability to learn and remember. During sleep, while your body rests, your brain is busy processing information from the day and forming memories. If you are sleep deprived, you are at risk of developing a number of serious health problems, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, and your ability to learn and retain new information may be impaired. This may not be news to anyone who has pulled an all-nighter cramming for a test only to find the facts and figures they knew at 2 a.m. could not be recalled the next day. Without adequate sleep, your brain becomes foggy, your judgment poor, and your fine motor skills hindered. Imaging and behavioral studies continue to show the critical role sleep plays in learning and memory. Researchers believe that sleep affects learning and memory in two ways: Lack of sleep impairs a person's ability to focus and learn efficiently. Sleep is necessary to consolidate a memory (make it stick) so that it can be recalled in the future. There are different types of memories. Some are fact-based, such as remembering the name of state capitals. Some are episodic -- based on events in your life, such as your first kiss. And some memories are procedural or instructional, such as how to ride a bike or play the piano. For something to become a memory, three functions must occur, including: Acquisition -- learning or experiencing something new Consolidation -- the memory becomes stable in the brain Recall -- having the ability to access the memory in the future Both acquisition and recall are functions that take place when you are awake. However, researchers believe sleep is required for consolidation of a memory, no matter the memory type. Without adequate sleep, your brain has a harder time absorbing and recalling new information. Sleep does more than help sharpen the mind. Studies show that sleep affects physical reflexes, fine motor skills, and judgment, too. One study showed that participants who were sleep deprived were more likely to think they were right when they were, in fact, wrong. Studies involving memory tests show that after a single night of sleep, or even a nap, people perform better, whether on a test, in the office, on the athletic field, or in a concert hall. Scientists don't know exactly how sleep enhances memory, but it appears to involve the brain's hippocampus and neocortex -- the part of the brain where long-term memories are stored. It is thought that during sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex, where it reviews and processes memories, helping them to last for the long term. Researchers continue to investigate the stages of sleep involved in making certain types of memories. Some studies have shown that certain kinds of memories become stable during rapid eye movement ( REM) sleep -- the time when you dream. Other studies have found that some types of memories are most often secured during slow-wave, deep sleep. Scientists are getting closer to understanding what sleep does to our brain, but there are still many questions to be answered. What's certain is that sleep is a biological necessity -- we need it to survive. Unfortunately, in this day and age, few of us are able to get the sleep we need to function our best. Experts recommend adults get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Although this may not be attainable every night, it should be the goal. Here are some tips to help you get more sleep: Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. Get regular exercise, but do not exercise close to bedtime. Experts recommend allowing at least three hours between exercise and bed. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine before going to sleep. Take time to unwind before going to sleep. Take a warm bath, read a book, drink some caffeine-free tea, and avoid any activities that can cause tension. Finish eating two to three hours before going to bed. Create a pleasant sleeping environment: make the room dark, cool, and comfortable. Use a sound machine, or other type of white noise device, to block out unwanted sounds. Do not watch TV or use the computer in bed. Use your bedroom for sleep and sex only. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including getting regular and quality sleep, can be a challenge, especially when you are stressed with a work deadline or test.

Sleep occurs in the brain, which is responsible for regulating our sleep cycle.  The brain is a long, complicated, and connected body that contains both brain stem cells and the skeletal muscles.  The bones of your legs are very important to your functioning of your body during your sleep cycle. Your lungs and other airways close completely around the time you wake up.  While this is the case, your lungs and airways remain open.  Eventually your breathing becomes deep and you have a chest pain. This can occur at any time in your life, but is most likely in a newborn baby. Other symptoms include irritability, crying, vomiting, diarrhea, and sweating. What treatment is appropriate for this type of condition? If this is diagnosed early enough, you can try medication, such as over-the-counter cough medicine. If the medicine does not work, the doctor may administer an injection called an epidural. This treatment is very effective, but it can be painful. Other ways to deal with sleepiness, including taking medication, are not recommended due to the risk of serious side effects.  Can I wear tight clothes during my sleep?

Preterm formula has a low risk for gastric cancer, but it may cause delayed gastric emptying. However, there is no research that has documented a link between preterm infant formula and delayed gastric emptying.  Preterm infants should receive a variety of nutritional supplements for optimal growth, development, and health.  preterm infants and those who have gastric ulceration should receive a course of beta-carotene supplements as recommended by their healthcare providers.  a long history of high-carbohydrate diets or high-protein diets should not be considered.

The 5-year survival rate for prostate cancer that has moved into nearby parts of the body is nearly 100%. Here's what you should know about your treatment and what to expect going forward. When this type of cancer spreads (your doctor may say it has metastasized), it tends to first show up in the tissues or lymph nodes that are closest to the prostate gland. If it's caught and treated in this point, which is known as \"regional\" stage, your odds or recovery are very good. If it travels further, the cancer usually ends up in your bones. At that point, the chances of survival drop to 29%. Your doctor will talk to you about your best treatment options. What you choose will largely depend on how far the cancer has spread and what symptoms, if any, you have. You may have already had surgery or radiation. Those treatments are sometimes used to target prostate cancer when it's still only in the prostate. When your cancer spreads, your doctor will most likely suggest hormone therapy. That usually means taking medication to lower the amount of androgen hormones (testosterone and DHT) in your body or prevent them from affecting cancer cells. A related but rarely used option is surgical castration. The doctor removes your testicles, where most of these hormones are made. If you don't like the idea of losing them, the doctor can fit you with silicone sacs to insert into your scrotum. They'll preserve the look and feel. If hormone therapy doesn't work, you might move on to vaccine therapy. The prostate cancer vaccine is designed to kick-start your immune system so it attacks cancer cells. Or your doctor might suggest chemotherapy. It might be a medication you take by mouth, or something your doctor injects into a vein. If prostate cancer has spread to your bones, you'll likely need medication to ease your pain, lower the risk of fractures, and keep your body's calcium levels steady. It can be dangerous if they go too high or too low. Your doctor might prescribe a drug to help keep your bones strong. You might take corticosteroids to control pain, probably along with a pain reliever. Which pain medicine you get could range from ibuprofen to morphine, depending on how bad your pain is. Your oncologist might also send you forradiation therapy in an effort to lessen bone pain and kill off cancer cells in your bones. Or he could inject you with a drug that gives off radiation. These medications are called radiopharmaceuticals. You might think you'd know it if your cancer has spread, but that's not always true. Most men with advanced prostate cancer don't have any symptoms. This is why your follow-up doctor visits are important. You're most likely to find out the cancer has spread if your doctor tests your blood and finds high levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA. He might also find it with a digital rectal exam or on an X-ray or other test. If you do have symptoms, they often include trouble peeing or blood in your urine. You might also feel very tired, short of breath, or lose weight without trying. You're more likely to feel pain if the cancer has gone into your bones. Where it hurts will depend on which bones it affects. For instance, you might feel hip or back pain if cancer has spread into your pelvic bones. No matter which treatments you decide to pursue, advanced prostate cancer is bound to take a toll on your day-to-day life. Loss of bladder control (incontinence), fatigue, and erectile dysfunction often go hand-in-hand with treatment. Men who have hormonal therapy may have hot flashes (similar to what many women have during menopause) or gain weight. Cancer that has spread to your bones can also be painful. Be sure to tell you doctor about any pain or side effects. There are a wide array of medications and procedures that can help you feel better.

The 5-year survival rate for prostate cancer that has moved into nearby parts of the body is nearly 100%. Here's what you should know about your treatment and what to expect going forward. When this type of cancer spreads (your doctor may say it has metastasized), it tends to first show up in the tissues or lymph nodes that are closest to the prostate gland. If it's caught and treated in this point, which is known as \"regional\" stage, your odds or recovery are very good. If it travels further, the cancer usually ends up in your bones. At that point, the chances of survival drop to 29%. Your doctor will talk to you about your best treatment options. What you choose will largely depend on how far the cancer has spread and what symptoms, if any, you have. You may have already had surgery or radiation. Those treatments are sometimes used to target prostate cancer when it's still only in the prostate. When your cancer spreads, your doctor will most likely suggest hormone therapy. That usually means taking medication to lower the amount of androgen hormones (testosterone and DHT) in your body or prevent them from affecting cancer cells. A related but rarely used option is surgical castration. The doctor removes your testicles, where most of these hormones are made. If you don't like the idea of losing them, the doctor can fit you with silicone sacs to insert into your scrotum. They'll preserve the look and feel. If hormone therapy doesn't work, you might move on to vaccine therapy. The prostate cancer vaccine is designed to kick-start your immune system so it attacks cancer cells. Or your doctor might suggest chemotherapy. It might be a medication you take by mouth, or something your doctor injects into a vein. If prostate cancer has spread to your bones, you'll likely need medication to ease your pain, lower the risk of fractures, and keep your body's calcium levels steady. It can be dangerous if they go too high or too low. Your doctor might prescribe a drug to help keep your bones strong. You might take corticosteroids to control pain, probably along with a pain reliever. Which pain medicine you get could range from ibuprofen to morphine, depending on how bad your pain is. Your oncologist might also send you forradiation therapy in an effort to lessen bone pain and kill off cancer cells in your bones. Or he could inject you with a drug that gives off radiation. These medications are called radiopharmaceuticals. You might think you'd know it if your cancer has spread, but that's not always true. Most men with advanced prostate cancer don't have any symptoms. This is why your follow-up doctor visits are important. You're most likely to find out the cancer has spread if your doctor tests your blood and finds high levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA. He might also find it with a digital rectal exam or on an X-ray or other test. If you do have symptoms, they often include trouble peeing or blood in your urine. You might also feel very tired, short of breath, or lose weight without trying. You're more likely to feel pain if the cancer has gone into your bones. Where it hurts will depend on which bones it affects. For instance, you might feel hip or back pain if cancer has spread into your pelvic bones. No matter which treatments you decide to pursue, advanced prostate cancer is bound to take a toll on your day-to-day life. Loss of bladder control (incontinence), fatigue, and erectile dysfunction often go hand-in-hand with treatment. Men who have hormonal therapy may have hot flashes (similar to what many women have during menopause) or gain weight. Cancer that has spread to your bones can also be painful. Be sure to tell you doctor about any pain or side effects. There are a wide array of medications and procedures that can help you feel better. Self-care is also important: Take naps to fight fatigue and try to do some light exercise, like walking, to keep your energy levels up.

A trip to the gym could seem like the last thing you want to do. But exercise is good for your head, and research backs this up. One study that involved 80 adults with mild to moderate major depression found that three sessions of heart-pumping activity each week for 12 weeks worked about as well as medication in fighting the symptoms of depression. The researchers also found that after 10 months, people who exercised were much less likely to relapse than people who took medicine. The results of another study showed that three to five weekly workouts that got the heart and lungs working harder cut mild to moderate symptoms of the mood disorder nearly in half. You don't have to start by signing up for a triathlon. Take simple steps to get into a new exercise routine. Start slow. If you do too much too fast, you'll probably wind up sore and discouraged. Instead, gradually work your way up. Begin by exercising for a few minutes or more on a few days of the week. Don't do more than that for a week or two. Slowly build up to 30 minutes or more, 5 days a week. Break it up. You don't have to get all of your physical activity in a single stretch or with one type of exercise. Many people prefer to do shorter workouts throughout the day, and they vary the types they do. Three 15-minute walks are as good as one 45-minute walk. Pick something you enjoy. A lot of people choose a sport not because they like it, but because they think it will be good for them. But if you treat exercise like a chore, you probably won't stick with it. Instead, try different activities until you find one or more that excite you. Maybe you can swim in a local pool, use a treadmill in front of the TV in your living room, go for hikes, or take an exercise class, for example. Get moving with other people. Solo workouts are sometimes hard to stick to. If you have a plan to do it with someone else, you might feel more committed. So find an exercise buddy. Make a date to walk with a neighbor at a set time on specific days. Or start up a regular tennis game with a friend. Many people find that structured classes, like aerobics or yoga, also help them stick with a program. Get more everyday physical activity. Work it into your daily routine whenever and wherever you can. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park a little farther away from your workplace, so you can sneak in some extra walking. Stuff your remote control under a couch cushion and get up to change the channel.

It may be silver in color. What you can do: Whether your condition is mild or severe, you may have to switch and combine treatments every now and then. That's because psoriasis can become resistant to a treatment after a while. If yours is mild, your dermatologist may recommend shampoos or topical solutions with tar or salicylic acid.

For more moderate to severe cases, you may get a prescription scalp ointment, liquid, cream, foam, or shampoo. Some of these have corticosteroids. If your psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis is severe and affects other areas of your body, you might be prescribed a medication that deals with all your symptoms. An example would be biologic drugs, which target specific parts of your immune system. If you notice a flare here, tell your doctor right away. It can lead to cracking, blistering, and swelling.

Experts believe that CRPS occurs as a result of dysfunction in the central or peripheral nervous systems. CRPS is most common in people ages 20-35. The syndrome also can occur in children; it affects women more often than men. There is no cure for CRPS. CRPS most likely does not have a single cause; rather, it results from multiple causes that produce similar symptoms. Some theories suggest that pain receptors in the affected part of the body become responsive to catecholamines, a group of nervous system messengers. In cases of injury-related CRPS, the syndrome may be caused by a triggering of the immune response, which may lead to the inflammatory symptoms of redness, warmth, and swelling in the affected area. For this reason, it is believed that CRPS may represent a disruption of the healing process. The symptoms of CRPS vary in their severity and length. One symptom of CRPS is continuous, intense pain that gets worse rather than better over time. If CRPS occurs after an injury, it may seem out of proportion to the severity of the injury. Even in cases involving an injury only to a finger or toe, pain can spread to include the entire arm or leg. In some cases, pain can even travel to the opposite extremity. Other symptoms of CRPS include: \" Burning\" pain Swelling and stiffness in affected joints Motor disability, with decreased ability to move the affected body part Changes in nail and hair growth pattern; there may be rapid hair growth or no hair growth. Skin changes; CRPS can involve changes in skin temperature -- skin on one extremity can feel warmer or cooler compared to the opposite extremity. Skin color may become blotchy, pale, purple or red. The texture of skin also can change, becoming shiny and thin. People with CRPS may have skin that sometimes is excessively sweaty. CRPS may be heightened by emotional stress. There is no specific diagnostic test for CRPS, but some testing can rule out other conditions. Triple-phase bone scans can be used to identify changes in the bone and in blood circulation. Some health care providers may apply a stimulus (for example, heat, touch, cold) to determine whether there is pain in a specific area. Making a firm diagnosis of CRPS may be difficult early in the course of the disorder when symptoms are few or mild. CRPS is diagnosed primarily through observation of the following symptoms: The presence of an initial injury A higher-than-expected amount of pain from an injury A change in appearance of an affected area No other cause of pain or altered appearance Because there is no cure for CRPS, the goal of treatment is to relieve painful symptoms associated with the disorder. Therapies used include psychotherapy, physical therapy, and drug treatment, such as topical analgesics, narcotics, corticosteroids, osteoporosis medication, antidepressants, osteoporosis medicines, and antiseizure drugs. Other treatments include: Sympathetic nerve blocks: These blocks, which are done in a variety of ways, can provide significant pain relief for some people. One kind of block involves placing an anesthetic next to the spine to directly block the sympathetic nerves. Surgical sympathectomy: This controversial technique destroys the nerves involved in CRPS. Some experts believe it has a favorable outcome, while others feel it makes CRPS worse. The technique should be considered only for people whose pain is dramatically but temporarily relieved by selective sympathetic blocks.

The purpose of clinical trials is to find new and improved methods of treating arthritis. Clinical trials make it possible to apply the latest scientific and technological advances in arthritis to patient care. During a clinical trial, doctors use the best available arthritis treatment as a standard to evaluate new treatments. The new treatments are considered to be at least as effective or possibly more effective than the standard. New treatment options are first researched in a laboratory where they are carefully studied in the test tube and in animals. Only the treatments most likely to work are further evaluated in a small group of humans prior to applying them in a larger clinical trial. When a new arthritis treatment is studied for the first time in humans, it is not known exactly how it will work. With any new treatment, there are possible risks as well as benefits. Clinical trials help doctors discover the answers to the following questions: Is the treatment safe and effective? Is the treatment potentially better than the treatments currently available? What are the side effects of the treatment? Does the treatment have any possible risks? How well does the treatment work? Clinical trials are conducted in phases, each designed to find out specific information. Each new phase of a clinical trial builds on information from previous phases. In a phase I clinical trial, the new arthritis treatment being investigated is given to a small number of participants. The researchers determine the best way to give the new treatment and how much of it can be given safely. Phase II clinical trials determine the effect of the research treatment on patients and usually the best dosage. In Phase III clinical trials, the drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used Phase IV clinical trials apply the new treatment to patient care. Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. The advantages of participating in a clinical trial include the following: You may receive a new arthritis treatment before it is widely available to the public. You can provide researchers with the information they need to continue developing new procedures and introducing new treatment methods. Your arthritis treatment costs may be decreased, since many of the tests and doctor visits that are directly related to the clinical trial are paid for by the company or agency sponsoring the study. Be sure to discuss your treatment costs with the doctors and nurses conducting the clinical trial. Potential side effects from participating in a clinical trial will depend on the type of treatment and the patient's condition. All of the risks and side effects of the treatment being researched are not known at the beginning of the clinical trial. Since this is the case, there may be unknown side effects, as well as hoped-for benefits. It's important to note that most arthritis treatments -- as well as the disease or condition itself -- have potential side effects. Patients will be informed of any known, possible side effects as well as any \"new\" side effects that occur or become known while they are participating in the trial.

Neither the participant nor the doctor will know which drug the patient is receiving. This is done to make certain that the real drug is effective. Clinical trial participants are willing volunteers. Even though patients may be asked by their doctors to take part in a clinical trial, it is up to each patient to make the final decision. Informed consent means that as a patient, you are given all available information so you can understand what is involved in a specific clinical trial. The doctors and nurses conducting the trial will explain the treatment to you, including its possible benefits and risks. You will be given an informed consent form to read and consider carefully. Before signing, be sure you find out as much as possible about the clinical trial, including what risks you may face. Ask the doctor or nurse to explain parts of the form or the trial that are not clear. You are free to decide whether or not you want to take part in the trial. If you decide to participate, you will sign the consent form. If you do not want to participate in the trial, you may refuse to sign the consent form. If you choose not to participate in the trial, your care will not be affected in any way. Your signature on the informed consent form does not bind you to the study. Even if you sign the form, you are free to leave the trial at any time to receive other available treatments. The informed consent process is ongoing. After you agree to participate in a clinical trial, you will continue to receive any new information about your treatment that may affect your willingness to stay in the trial. Every clinical trial is designed to meet a specific set of research criteria. Each study enrolls patients with certain conditions and symptoms. If you fit the guidelines for a trial, you may be able to participate. In some instances, you may be required to undergo certain tests to confirm your acceptance. Every patient faces a new world of medical terms and procedures. Fears and myths of \"experimentation\" or \"being a guinea pig\" are common concerns of arthritis patients who are thinking about participating in a clinical trial. Even though there are always going to be fears of the unknown, understanding what is involved in a clinical trial before agreeing to participate can relieve some of your anxieties. Here's some information that may help ease your concerns: The personal information gathered about you during the clinical trial will remain confidential and will not be reported with your name attached. If at any time during the trial your doctor feels it is in your best interest to exit the trial and use other known treatments, you will be free to do so. This will not in any way affect your future arthritis treatment. Clinical trial participants typically receive their care in the same places that the standard arthritis treatments are given -- in clinics or doctors' offices. Clinical trial participants will be watched closely and data on their case will be carefully recorded and reviewed. If you are thinking about taking part in a clinical trial, find out as much as possible about the study before you decide to participate. Here are some important questions to ask: What is the purpose of the clinical trial? What kinds of tests and treatments does the clinical trial involve? How are these tests given? What is likely to happen in my case with, or without, this new research treatment? Are there standard treatment options for my arthritis, and how does the study treatment compare with them? How could the clinical trial affect my daily life? What side effects can I expect from the clinical trial? ( Note: There can also be side effects from standard arthritis treatments and from the disease itself.) How long will the clinical trial last? Will the clinical trial require extra time on my part? Will I have to be hospitalized? If so, how often and for how long? If I agree to withdraw from the clinical trial, will my care be affected? Will I need to change doctors?", "question": "What questions are researchers trying to answer during a clinical trial for a new arthritis treatment?", "answer": ["When a new arthritis treatment is studied for the first time in humans, it is not known exactly how it will work.

In these diseases, called autoimmune diseases, the body's normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues. The body responds as if normal tissues are infected or somehow abnormal. Some, but not all, types of arthritis are the result of misdirected inflammation. Arthritis is a general term that describes inflammation in the joints. Some types of arthritis associated with inflammation include the following: Rheumatoid arthritis Psoriatic arthritis Gouty arthritis Other painful conditions of the joints and musculoskeletal system that may not be associated with inflammation include osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, muscular low back pain, and muscular neck pain. Symptoms of inflammation include: Redness Swollen joint that's sometimes warm to the touch Joint pain Joint stiffness Loss of joint function Often, only a few of these symptoms are present. Inflammation may also be associated with general flu-like symptoms including: Fever Chills Fatigue/loss of energy Headaches Loss of appetite Muscle stiffness When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body from foreign substances. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain. The increased number of cells and inflammatory substances within the joint cause irritation, swelling of the joint lining and, eventually, wearing down of cartilage (cushions at the end of bones). Inflammatory diseases are diagnosed after careful evaluation of the following: Complete medical history and physical exam with attention to: The pattern of painful joints and whether there is evidence of inflammation Presence of joint stiffness in the morning Evaluation of other symptoms Results of X-rays and blood tests Yes. Inflammation can affect organs as part of an autoimmune disorder. The type of symptoms depend on which organs are affected. For example: Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) may cause shortness of breath or fluid retention. Inflammation of the small tubes that transport air to the lungs may cause shortness of breath. Inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis) may cause high blood pressure or kidney failure. Pain may not be a primary symptom of an inflammatory disease, since many organs do not have many pain-sensitive nerves. Treatment of organ inflammation is directed at the cause of inflammation whenever possible. There are a number of treatment options for inflammatory diseases, like arthritis, including medications, rest, exercise, and surgery to correct joint damage. The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the type of disease, the person's age, type of medications he or she is taking, overall health, medical history, and severity of symptoms.

They are often used in combination due to their differing effects. The medications include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen) Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) Antimalarial medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) Other oral drugs known as DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), including methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide Biologic drugs such as infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, and rituximab Some of these medications are also used to treat other conditions such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, or to reduce the risk of rejection of a transplanted organ. However, when \"chemotherapy\" types of medications (such as methotrexate or cyclophosphamide) are used to treat inflammatory diseases, the doses are sometimes significantly lower and the risks of side effects tend to be less than when prescribed in higher doses for cancer treatment.

Symptoms of inflammation include: Redness Swollen joint that's sometimes warm to the touch Joint pain Joint stiffness Loss of joint function Often, only a few of these symptoms are present. Inflammation may also be associated with general flu-like symptoms including: Fever Chills Fatigue/loss of energy Headaches Loss of appetite Muscle stiffness When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body from foreign substances. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. Some of the chemicals cause a leak of fluid into the tissues, resulting in swelling. This protective process may stimulate nerves and cause pain. The increased number of cells and inflammatory substances within the joint cause irritation, swelling of the joint lining and, eventually, wearing down of cartilage (cushions at the end of bones). Inflammatory diseases are diagnosed after careful evaluation of the following: Complete medical history and physical exam with attention to: The pattern of painful joints and whether there is evidence of inflammation Presence of joint stiffness in the morning Evaluation of other symptoms Results of X-rays and blood tests Yes. Inflammation can affect organs as part of an autoimmune disorder. The type of symptoms depend on which organs are affected. For example: Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis) may cause shortness of breath or fluid retention. Inflammation of the small tubes that transport air to the lungs may cause shortness of breath. Inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis) may cause high blood pressure or kidney failure. Pain may not be a primary symptom of an inflammatory disease, since many organs do not have many pain-sensitive nerves. Treatment of organ inflammation is directed at the cause of inflammation whenever possible. There are a number of treatment options for inflammatory diseases, like arthritis, including medications, rest, exercise, and surgery to correct joint damage. The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors, including the type of disease, the person's age, type of medications he or she is taking, overall health, medical history, and severity of symptoms. The goals of treatment are the following: Correct, control, or slow down the underlying disease process Avoid or modify activities that aggravate pain Relieve pain through pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs Maintain joint movement and muscle strength through physical therapy Decrease stress on the joints by using braces, splints, or canes as needed There are many drugs available to decrease joint pain, swelling and inflammation, and possibly prevent or minimize the progression of the inflammatory disease. They are often used in combination due to their differing effects. The medications include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen) Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) Antimalarial medications (such as hydroxychloroquine) Other oral drugs known as DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), including methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide Biologic drugs such as infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, and rituximab Some of these medications are also used to treat other conditions such as cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, or to reduce the risk of rejection of a transplanted organ. However, when \"chemotherapy\" types of medications (such as methotrexate or cyclophosphamide) are used to treat inflammatory diseases, the doses are sometimes significantly lower and the risks of side effects tend to be less than when prescribed in higher doses for cancer treatment.

This fluid is produced and stored in cavities in the brain called ventricles. It circulates around the brain, moving from ventricle to ventricle. The purposes of the fluid are to cushion and protect the brain and spinal cord, to supply them with nutrients, and to remove some of their waste products.

This occurs when the natural system for draining and absorbing extra CSF does not work right. The ventricles enlarge to accommodate the extra fluid and then press on different parts of the brain, causing a number of different symptoms. Hydrocephalus has many different causes. Some people are born with the condition, while others develop it during their lives. Normal pressure hydrocephalus ( NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually occurs in older adults. The average age of person with NPH is over age 60. NPH is different than other types of hydrocephalus in that it develops slowly over time. The drainage of CSF is blocked gradually, and the excess fluid builds up slowly. The slow enlargement of the ventricles means that the fluid pressure in the brain may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. However, the enlarged ventricles still press on the brain and can cause symptoms (the term \"normal pressure\" is somewhat misleading). The parts of the brain most often affected in NPH are those that control the legs, the bladder, and the \"cognitive\" mental processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, and speaking. This decline in mental processes, if it is severe enough to interfere with everyday activities, is known as dementia. Other symptoms include abnormal gait (difficulty walking), inability to hold urine (urinary incontinence), and, occasionally, inability to control the bowels. The dementia symptoms of NPH can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. Experts say that many cases of NPH are misdiagnosed as one of these diseases. The good news is that, unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. But first it must be correctly diagnosed. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can occur after a head injury, bleeding around the brain (due to a blow to the head), stroke, meningitis (infection of a protective layer of tissue around the brain), or brain tumor. It can happen after surgery on the brain. How these conditions lead to NPH is not clear. In most cases, the cause of NPH is never known. At first, the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus are usually very subtle. They worsen very gradually. Symptoms of dementia include: Memory loss Speech problems Apathy (indifference) and withdrawal Changes in behavior or mood Difficulties with reasoning, paying attention, or judgment Walking problems Unsteadiness Leg weakness Sudden falls Shuffling steps Difficulty taking the first step, as if feet were stuck to the floor \" Getting stuck\" or \"freezing\" while walking Urinary symptoms Inability to hold urine Inability to hold stool, or feces (less common) Frequent urination Urgency to urinate The following symptoms can be related to increased pressure in the brain: Headache Nausea Difficulty focusing eyes Some people think that memory loss, difficulty finding words, walking problems, or urination problems are normal parts of aging. In many cases, however, these are symptoms of treatable conditions. Any of these problems, or changes in mood or behavior, warrants a visit to your health care provider. The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus can also occur in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the combination of dementia-like symptoms, walking problems, and urinary problems should alert your health care provider to the possibility of NPH. Making the distinction is very important because the treatments for these conditions are quite different. Tests are available that can diagnose NPH. At any point in this process, your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in brain disorders (neurologist or neurosurgeon) to complete the evaluation and begin treatment. The evaluation begins with a medical interview. The medical professional will ask you questions about your symptoms and when they started, your medical and mental problems now and in the past, your family's medical problems, medications you have taken now and in the past, your work and travel experiences, and your habits and lifestyle. This is followed by a detailed physical exam to document your condition and rule out other disorders that might cause similar symptoms. The exam will probably include tests of your mental status, such as answering questions and following simple directions. Neuropsychological testing may be performed to document your dementia symptoms. Neuropsychological testing is the most accurate method of pinpointing and documenting a person's cognitive problems and strengths. Lab Tests There is no lab test that confirms the diagnosis of NPH. Any lab tests that are done are probably being done to rule out conditions that might cause similar symptoms. Imaging Tests CT scan of the head: This scan is similar to an X-ray but gives a more detailed, 3-dimensional picture of the brain. It cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH, but it can show ventricular enlargement or other changes that suggest NPH. Newer techniques can actually measure the flow of CSF in the brain. These findings alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis. This scan is safe and painless. MRI of the head : This scan uses radio signals and a strong magnet to create a detailed picture of the brain. It is safe and painless, like a CT scan, but takes longer (about 30 minutes). It also cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH. Cisternography: This test is much more involved than CT scan or MRI and is not widely used. It highlights absorption of the CSF. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This procedure involves removal of CSF from the area around the spinal cord in the lower back. The CSF pressure is measured, and the fluid that is removed is analyzed for abnormalities that might give a clue as to the problem. Usually, more fluid is removed than is necessary for these tests, the idea being that removal of a large volume of CSF may help relieve symptoms (this is checked by comparing exam results before and after). If symptoms are relieved, it is usually temporary; improvement of symptoms with lumbar puncture is commonly interpreted as meaning that a surgical shunt would be helpful in that person. Normal pressure hydrocephalus generally cannot be cured. It is a long-term condition. However, many people with the condition obtain substantial relief through surgical treatment. For those who are not candidates for surgery, treatment consists of measures to relieve mood and behavioral problems, cope with physical problems such as incontinence and walking difficulties, and maximize physical, mental, and social functioning. An individual with normal pressure hydrocephalus should always be under the care of a medical professional. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family and caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual's health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia and other symptoms of NPH. The degree of care required by people with NPH varies considerably. Those who undergo successful shunt surgery may continue to live a normal or near-normal independent life. Others will experience worsening of their symptoms over time. Many of these individuals will eventually require close supervision and care. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon should discuss with you and your family what to expect as time goes on. It's important to know that no drug or other medical treatment is known to work in NPH. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is not caused by any structural abnormality, such as a brain tumor. In most cases, the underlying problem is not known or cannot be treated. The treatment in these cases is a shunt operation. A shunt is a thin tube that is implanted in the brain by a neurosurgeon. It is inserted into the ventricles to drain excess CSF away from the brain. The tube is routed under the skin from the head to another part of the body, usually the peritoneum (the lower belly). The shunt is equipped with a valve that opens to release fluid when the pressure builds up. The fluid drains harmlessly and is later absorbed by the bloodstream. The pressure setting on the valve sometimes must be readjusted. The newer shunts allow adjustment without another operation. A shunt operation is not a cure. It does not treat the underlying cause of NPH. It can, however, relieve the symptoms. The shunt remains in place indefinitely. If properly implanted, the shunt often is not obvious to other people. Shunt operations do not work for everyone with NPH. Many people who undergo a shunt operation have substantial symptom relief. In some, the symptoms improve and then start to worsen again. Others benefit little, if at all. Even the experts are not able to predict perfectly who will benefit and who will not. Many surgeons perform a spinal tap before surgery to test whether the symptoms get better with removal of fluid. In some cases, the person is hospitalized for a few days while fluid is drained slowly through a small tube called a catheter. This is another way of checking whether removing extra fluid will help symptoms. The earlier the NPH is diagnosed, the better the chances that the surgery will help. In general, people with milder symptoms have better outcomes with this surgery. Like any surgery, the shunt operation can cause complications. Such complications include infection of the shunt and blood clots around the brain. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will discuss the pros and cons of this operation and whether it might work for you. Another operation is sometimes used instead of shunt placement. In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, an endoscope (thin tube with a lighted camera on the end) is used to create a small hole in the floor of the ventricles. The hole provides another way for CSF to drain from the brain. If you have NPH, you should have regular visits with your neurologist or neurosurgeon. These visits allow the doctor to monitor your symptoms. Changes in symptoms may require adjustments in care. There is no known way to prevent NPH. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH. NPH is a progressive condition, meaning that the symptoms gradually worsen if not treated. In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Some people improve dramatically after surgery, while others do not. Some are not candidates for surgery. Those who are not candidates for surgery have few treatment options available. Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members. The condition affects every aspect of your life, including family relationships, work, financial status, social life, and physical and mental health. You may feel overwhelmed, depressed, frustrated, angry, or resentful. These feelings do not help the situation and usually make it worse. This is why support groups were invented.

This occurs when the natural system for draining and absorbing extra CSF does not work right. The ventricles enlarge to accommodate the extra fluid and then press on different parts of the brain, causing a number of different symptoms. Hydrocephalus has many different causes. Some people are born with the condition, while others develop it during their lives. Normal pressure hydrocephalus ( NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually occurs in older adults. The average age of person with NPH is over age 60. NPH is different than other types of hydrocephalus in that it develops slowly over time. The drainage of CSF is blocked gradually, and the excess fluid builds up slowly. The slow enlargement of the ventricles means that the fluid pressure in the brain may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. However, the enlarged ventricles still press on the brain and can cause symptoms (the term \"normal pressure\" is somewhat misleading). The parts of the brain most often affected in NPH are those that control the legs, the bladder, and the \"cognitive\" mental processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, and speaking. This decline in mental processes, if it is severe enough to interfere with everyday activities, is known as dementia. Other symptoms include abnormal gait (difficulty walking), inability to hold urine (urinary incontinence), and, occasionally, inability to control the bowels. The dementia symptoms of NPH can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. Experts say that many cases of NPH are misdiagnosed as one of these diseases. The good news is that, unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. But first it must be correctly diagnosed. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can occur after a head injury, bleeding around the brain (due to a blow to the head), stroke, meningitis (infection of a protective layer of tissue around the brain), or brain tumor. It can happen after surgery on the brain. How these conditions lead to NPH is not clear. In most cases, the cause of NPH is never known. At first, the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus are usually very subtle. They worsen very gradually. Symptoms of dementia include: Memory loss Speech problems Apathy (indifference) and withdrawal Changes in behavior or mood Difficulties with reasoning, paying attention, or judgment Walking problems Unsteadiness Leg weakness Sudden falls Shuffling steps Difficulty taking the first step, as if feet were stuck to the floor \" Getting stuck\" or \"freezing\" while walking Urinary symptoms Inability to hold urine Inability to hold stool, or feces (less common) Frequent urination Urgency to urinate The following symptoms can be related to increased pressure in the brain: Headache Nausea Difficulty focusing eyes Some people think that memory loss, difficulty finding words, walking problems, or urination problems are normal parts of aging. In many cases, however, these are symptoms of treatable conditions. Any of these problems, or changes in mood or behavior, warrants a visit to your health care provider. The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus can also occur in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the combination of dementia-like symptoms, walking problems, and urinary problems should alert your health care provider to the possibility of NPH. Making the distinction is very important because the treatments for these conditions are quite different. Tests are available that can diagnose NPH. At any point in this process, your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in brain disorders (neurologist or neurosurgeon) to complete the evaluation and begin treatment. The evaluation begins with a medical interview. The medical professional will ask you questions about your symptoms and when they started, your medical and mental problems now and in the past, your family's medical problems, medications you have taken now and in the past, your work and travel experiences, and your habits and lifestyle. This is followed by a detailed physical exam to document your condition and rule out other disorders that might cause similar symptoms. The exam will probably include tests of your mental status, such as answering questions and following simple directions. Neuropsychological testing may be performed to document your dementia symptoms. Neuropsychological testing is the most accurate method of pinpointing and documenting a person's cognitive problems and strengths. Lab Tests There is no lab test that confirms the diagnosis of NPH. Any lab tests that are done are probably being done to rule out conditions that might cause similar symptoms. Imaging Tests CT scan of the head: This scan is similar to an X-ray but gives a more detailed, 3-dimensional picture of the brain. It cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH, but it can show ventricular enlargement or other changes that suggest NPH. Newer techniques can actually measure the flow of CSF in the brain. These findings alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis. This scan is safe and painless. MRI of the head : This scan uses radio signals and a strong magnet to create a detailed picture of the brain. It is safe and painless, like a CT scan, but takes longer (about 30 minutes). It also cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH. Cisternography: This test is much more involved than CT scan or MRI and is not widely used. It highlights absorption of the CSF. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This procedure involves removal of CSF from the area around the spinal cord in the lower back. The CSF pressure is measured, and the fluid that is removed is analyzed for abnormalities that might give a clue as to the problem. Usually, more fluid is removed than is necessary for these tests, the idea being that removal of a large volume of CSF may help relieve symptoms (this is checked by comparing exam results before and after). If symptoms are relieved, it is usually temporary; improvement of symptoms with lumbar puncture is commonly interpreted as meaning that a surgical shunt would be helpful in that person. Normal pressure hydrocephalus generally cannot be cured. It is a long-term condition. However, many people with the condition obtain substantial relief through surgical treatment. For those who are not candidates for surgery, treatment consists of measures to relieve mood and behavioral problems, cope with physical problems such as incontinence and walking difficulties, and maximize physical, mental, and social functioning. An individual with normal pressure hydrocephalus should always be under the care of a medical professional. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family and caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual's health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia and other symptoms of NPH. The degree of care required by people with NPH varies considerably. Those who undergo successful shunt surgery may continue to live a normal or near-normal independent life. Others will experience worsening of their symptoms over time. Many of these individuals will eventually require close supervision and care. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon should discuss with you and your family what to expect as time goes on. It's important to know that no drug or other medical treatment is known to work in NPH. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is not caused by any structural abnormality, such as a brain tumor. In most cases, the underlying problem is not known or cannot be treated. The treatment in these cases is a shunt operation. A shunt is a thin tube that is implanted in the brain by a neurosurgeon. It is inserted into the ventricles to drain excess CSF away from the brain. The tube is routed under the skin from the head to another part of the body, usually the peritoneum (the lower belly). The shunt is equipped with a valve that opens to release fluid when the pressure builds up. The fluid drains harmlessly and is later absorbed by the bloodstream. The pressure setting on the valve sometimes must be readjusted. The newer shunts allow adjustment without another operation. A shunt operation is not a cure. It does not treat the underlying cause of NPH. It can, however, relieve the symptoms. The shunt remains in place indefinitely. If properly implanted, the shunt often is not obvious to other people. Shunt operations do not work for everyone with NPH. Many people who undergo a shunt operation have substantial symptom relief. In some, the symptoms improve and then start to worsen again. Others benefit little, if at all. Even the experts are not able to predict perfectly who will benefit and who will not. Many surgeons perform a spinal tap before surgery to test whether the symptoms get better with removal of fluid. In some cases, the person is hospitalized for a few days while fluid is drained slowly through a small tube called a catheter. This is another way of checking whether removing extra fluid will help symptoms. The earlier the NPH is diagnosed, the better the chances that the surgery will help. In general, people with milder symptoms have better outcomes with this surgery. Like any surgery, the shunt operation can cause complications. Such complications include infection of the shunt and blood clots around the brain. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will discuss the pros and cons of this operation and whether it might work for you. Another operation is sometimes used instead of shunt placement. In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, an endoscope (thin tube with a lighted camera on the end) is used to create a small hole in the floor of the ventricles. The hole provides another way for CSF to drain from the brain. If you have NPH, you should have regular visits with your neurologist or neurosurgeon. These visits allow the doctor to monitor your symptoms. Changes in symptoms may require adjustments in care. There is no known way to prevent NPH. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH. NPH is a progressive condition, meaning that the symptoms gradually worsen if not treated. In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Some people improve dramatically after surgery, while others do not. Some are not candidates for surgery. Those who are not candidates for surgery have few treatment options available. Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members. The condition affects every aspect of your life, including family relationships, work, financial status, social life, and physical and mental health. You may feel overwhelmed, depressed, frustrated, angry, or resentful. These feelings do not help the situation and usually make it worse. This is why support groups were invented. Support groups are groups of people who have lived through the same difficult experiences and want to help themselves and others by sharing coping strategies.

Symptoms of dementia include: Memory loss Speech problems Apathy (indifference) and withdrawal Changes in behavior or mood Difficulties with reasoning, paying attention, or judgment Walking problems Unsteadiness Leg weakness Sudden falls Shuffling steps Difficulty taking the first step, as if feet were stuck to the floor \" Getting stuck\" or \"freezing\" while walking Urinary symptoms Inability to hold urine Inability to hold stool, or feces (less common) Frequent urination Urgency to urinate The following symptoms can be related to increased pressure in the brain: Headache Nausea Difficulty focusing eyes Some people think that memory loss, difficulty finding words, walking problems, or urination problems are normal parts of aging. In many cases, however, these are symptoms of treatable conditions. Any of these problems, or changes in mood or behavior, warrants a visit to your health care provider. The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus can also occur in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the combination of dementia-like symptoms, walking problems, and urinary problems should alert your health care provider to the possibility of NPH. Making the distinction is very important because the treatments for these conditions are quite different. Tests are available that can diagnose NPH. At any point in this process, your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in brain disorders (neurologist or neurosurgeon) to complete the evaluation and begin treatment. The evaluation begins with a medical interview. The medical professional will ask you questions about your symptoms and when they started, your medical and mental problems now and in the past, your family's medical problems, medications you have taken now and in the past, your work and travel experiences, and your habits and lifestyle. This is followed by a detailed physical exam to document your condition and rule out other disorders that might cause similar symptoms. The exam will probably include tests of your mental status, such as answering questions and following simple directions. Neuropsychological testing may be performed to document your dementia symptoms. Neuropsychological testing is the most accurate method of pinpointing and documenting a person's cognitive problems and strengths. Lab Tests There is no lab test that confirms the diagnosis of NPH. Any lab tests that are done are probably being done to rule out conditions that might cause similar symptoms. Imaging Tests CT scan of the head: This scan is similar to an X-ray but gives a more detailed, 3-dimensional picture of the brain. It cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH, but it can show ventricular enlargement or other changes that suggest NPH. Newer techniques can actually measure the flow of CSF in the brain. These findings alone may not be sufficient for diagnosis. This scan is safe and painless. MRI of the head : This scan uses radio signals and a strong magnet to create a detailed picture of the brain. It is safe and painless, like a CT scan, but takes longer (about 30 minutes). It also cannot confirm a diagnosis of NPH. Cisternography: This test is much more involved than CT scan or MRI and is not widely used. It highlights absorption of the CSF. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This procedure involves removal of CSF from the area around the spinal cord in the lower back. The CSF pressure is measured, and the fluid that is removed is analyzed for abnormalities that might give a clue as to the problem. Usually, more fluid is removed than is necessary for these tests, the idea being that removal of a large volume of CSF may help relieve symptoms (this is checked by comparing exam results before and after). If symptoms are relieved, it is usually temporary; improvement of symptoms with lumbar puncture is commonly interpreted as meaning that a surgical shunt would be helpful in that person. Normal pressure hydrocephalus generally cannot be cured. It is a long-term condition. However, many people with the condition obtain substantial relief through surgical treatment. For those who are not candidates for surgery, treatment consists of measures to relieve mood and behavioral problems, cope with physical problems such as incontinence and walking difficulties, and maximize physical, mental, and social functioning. An individual with normal pressure hydrocephalus should always be under the care of a medical professional. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family and caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual's health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia and other symptoms of NPH. The degree of care required by people with NPH varies considerably. Those who undergo successful shunt surgery may continue to live a normal or near-normal independent life. Others will experience worsening of their symptoms over time. Many of these individuals will eventually require close supervision and care. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon should discuss with you and your family what to expect as time goes on. It's important to know that no drug or other medical treatment is known to work in NPH. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is not caused by any structural abnormality, such as a brain tumor. In most cases, the underlying problem is not known or cannot be treated. The treatment in these cases is a shunt operation. A shunt is a thin tube that is implanted in the brain by a neurosurgeon. It is inserted into the ventricles to drain excess CSF away from the brain. The tube is routed under the skin from the head to another part of the body, usually the peritoneum (the lower belly). The shunt is equipped with a valve that opens to release fluid when the pressure builds up. The fluid drains harmlessly and is later absorbed by the bloodstream. The pressure setting on the valve sometimes must be readjusted. The newer shunts allow adjustment without another operation. A shunt operation is not a cure. It does not treat the underlying cause of NPH. It can, however, relieve the symptoms. The shunt remains in place indefinitely. If properly implanted, the shunt often is not obvious to other people. Shunt operations do not work for everyone with NPH. Many people who undergo a shunt operation have substantial symptom relief. In some, the symptoms improve and then start to worsen again. Others benefit little, if at all. Even the experts are not able to predict perfectly who will benefit and who will not. Many surgeons perform a spinal tap before surgery to test whether the symptoms get better with removal of fluid. In some cases, the person is hospitalized for a few days while fluid is drained slowly through a small tube called a catheter. This is another way of checking whether removing extra fluid will help symptoms. The earlier the NPH is diagnosed, the better the chances that the surgery will help. In general, people with milder symptoms have better outcomes with this surgery. Like any surgery, the shunt operation can cause complications. Such complications include infection of the shunt and blood clots around the brain. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will discuss the pros and cons of this operation and whether it might work for you. Another operation is sometimes used instead of shunt placement. In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, an endoscope (thin tube with a lighted camera on the end) is used to create a small hole in the floor of the ventricles. The hole provides another way for CSF to drain from the brain. If you have NPH, you should have regular visits with your neurologist or neurosurgeon. These visits allow the doctor to monitor your symptoms. Changes in symptoms may require adjustments in care. There is no known way to prevent NPH. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH. NPH is a progressive condition, meaning that the symptoms gradually worsen if not treated. In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Some people improve dramatically after surgery, while others do not. Some are not candidates for surgery. Those who are not candidates for surgery have few treatment options available. Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members. The condition affects every aspect of your life, including family relationships, work, financial status, social life, and physical and mental health. You may feel overwhelmed, depressed, frustrated, angry, or resentful. These feelings do not help the situation and usually make it worse. This is why support groups were invented. Support groups are groups of people who have lived through the same difficult experiences and want to help themselves and others by sharing coping strategies.

For example, in severe cases, the brain may be removed or damaged.\n\nThis is why physicians consider hydrocephalus surgery to be a very aggressive treatment. It usually requires multiple operations.\n\nHydrocephalus surgery can only be performed under general anesthesia. However, some people choose to receive surgery under general anesthesia. These are known as deep brain stimulation (DBS).\n\nDr. Johnathan Daskalakis, chief of cranial surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital and head of the hospital's stroke center, was instrumental in developing DBS to treat severe brain hemorrhage.

This occurs when the natural system for draining and absorbing extra CSF does not work right. The ventricles enlarge to accommodate the extra fluid and then press on different parts of the brain, causing a number of different symptoms. Hydrocephalus has many different causes. Some people are born with the condition, while others develop it during their lives. Normal pressure hydrocephalus ( NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually occurs in older adults. The average age of person with NPH is over age 60. NPH is different than other types of hydrocephalus in that it develops slowly over time. The drainage of CSF is blocked gradually, and the excess fluid builds up slowly. The slow enlargement of the ventricles means that the fluid pressure in the brain may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. However, the enlarged ventricles still press on the brain and can cause symptoms (the term \"normal pressure\" is somewhat misleading). The parts of the brain most often affected in NPH are those that control the legs, the bladder, and the \"cognitive\" mental processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, and speaking. This decline in mental processes, if it is severe enough to interfere with everyday activities, is known as dementia. Other symptoms include abnormal gait (difficulty walking), inability to hold urine (urinary incontinence), and, occasionally, inability to control the bowels. The dementia symptoms of NPH can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. Experts say that many cases of NPH are misdiagnosed as one of these diseases. The good news is that, unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. But first it must be correctly diagnosed. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can occur after a head injury, bleeding around the brain (due to a blow to the head), stroke, meningitis (infection of a protective layer of tissue around the brain), or brain tumor. It can happen after surgery on the brain. How these conditions lead to NPH is not clear. In most cases, the cause of NPH is never known.

Shunt operations do not work for everyone with NPH. Many people who undergo a shunt operation have substantial symptom relief. In some, the symptoms improve and then start to worsen again. Others benefit little, if at all. Even the experts are not able to predict perfectly who will benefit and who will not. Many surgeons perform a spinal tap before surgery to test whether the symptoms get better with removal of fluid. In some cases, the person is hospitalized for a few days while fluid is drained slowly through a small tube called a catheter. This is another way of checking whether removing extra fluid will help symptoms. The earlier the NPH is diagnosed, the better the chances that the surgery will help. In general, people with milder symptoms have better outcomes with this surgery. Like any surgery, the shunt operation can cause complications. Such complications include infection of the shunt and blood clots around the brain. Your neurologist or neurosurgeon will discuss the pros and cons of this operation and whether it might work for you. Another operation is sometimes used instead of shunt placement. In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, an endoscope (thin tube with a lighted camera on the end) is used to create a small hole in the floor of the ventricles. The hole provides another way for CSF to drain from the brain. If you have NPH, you should have regular visits with your neurologist or neurosurgeon. These visits allow the doctor to monitor your symptoms. Changes in symptoms may require adjustments in care. There is no known way to prevent NPH. A healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular exercise, may help avoid conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke that might contribute to NPH. Wearing a seatbelt and safety helmet when indicated can help avoid head injury, another cause of NPH. NPH is a progressive condition, meaning that the symptoms gradually worsen if not treated. In general, the outlook depends on the cause of the hydrocephalus and whether you are a candidate for surgery. Some people improve dramatically after surgery, while others do not. Some are not candidates for surgery. Those who are not candidates for surgery have few treatment options available. Coping with the symptoms of NPH can be difficult for both you and your family members. The condition affects every aspect of your life, including family relationships, work, financial status, social life, and physical and mental health. You may feel overwhelmed, depressed, frustrated, angry, or resentful. These feelings do not help the situation and usually make it worse. This is why support groups were invented. Support groups are groups of people who have lived through the same difficult experiences and want to help themselves and others by sharing coping strategies. Support groups meet in person, on the telephone, or on the Internet. To find a support group that works for you, contact the organizations listed below.

Almost all kidney cancers first appear in the lining of tiny tubes (tubules) in the kidney. This type of kidney cancer is called renal cell carcinoma. The good news is that most of kidney cancers are found before they spread (metastasize) to distant organs. And cancers caught early are easier to treat successfully. However, these tumors can grow to be quite large before they are detected. var s_context; s_context= s_context || {}; s_context['wb.modimp'] = 'vidfloat'; if(webmd.useragent && webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop'){ webmd.ads2.disable Initial Load(); webmd.ads2.disable Ads Init = true; $(function() { webmd.p.pim.increment(); $('.responsive-video-container').insert After('.module-social-share-container'); require(['video2/1/responsive-player/video-loader'], function(video Loader) { video Loader.init({ autoplay: webmd.useragent.ua.type === 'desktop' && ! !s_sensitive, chron ID: $('article embeded_module[type=video][align=top]:eq(0)').attr('chronic_id'), continuous Play: true, cp Options: { flyout: true }, display Ads: true, mode: 'in-article', sticky: true }) }); }); } else { $(function(){ $('.responsive-video-container').remove(); }); } The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They lie in your lower abdomen on each side of your spine. Their main job is to clean your blood, removing waste products and making urine. Doctors don't know the causes of kidney cancer. But certain factors appear to increase the risk of getting kidney cancer. For example, kidney cancer occurs most often in people older than age 40. These are some other risk factors for kidney cancer: Smoking . If you smoke cigarettes, your risk for kidney cancer is twice that of nonsmokers. Smoking cigars may also increase your risk. Being male. Men are about twice as likely as women to get kidney cancer. Being obese. Extra weight may cause changes to hormones that increase your risk. Using certain pain medications for a long time. This includes over-the-counter drugs in addition to prescription drugs. Having advanced kidney disease or being on long-term dialysis, a treatment for people with kidneys that have stopped working Having certain genetic conditions, such as von Hippel- Lindau ( VHL) disease or inherited papillary renal cell carcinoma Having a family history of kidney cancer. The risk is especially high in siblings. Being exposed to certain chemicals, such as asbestos, cadmium, benzene, organic solvents, or certain herbicides Having high blood pressure. Doctors don't know whether high blood pressure or medication used to treat it is the source of the increased risk. Being black. The risk in blacks is slightly higher than in whites. No one knows why. Having lymphoma. For an unknown reason, there is an increased risk of kidney cancer in patients with lymphoma. Having these risk factors does not mean you will get kidney cancer. And it's also true that you can have none of them and still get the disease. In many cases, people may have no early symptoms of kidney cancer. As the tumor grows larger, symptoms may appear. You may have one or more of these kidney cancer symptoms: Blood in your urine A lump in your side or abdomen A loss of appetite A pain in your side that doesn't go away Weight loss that occurs for no known reason Fever that lasts for weeks and isn't caused by a cold or other infection Extreme fatigue Anemia Swelling in your ankles or legs Kidney cancer that spreads to other parts of your body may cause other symptoms, such as: Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Bone pain Maybe you've had kidney cancer symptoms such as pain in your side, weight loss, or extreme fatigue. Or maybe your doctor has found a lump in your side during a routine exam or a sign of kidney cancer during a test for another disease. Regardless, to confirm a diagnosis of kidney cancer, you will need a thorough physical exam, health history, and tests. Your doctor will feel your abdomen and side for lumps and check for fever and high blood pressure, among other things. You will also answer questions about your health habits, any past illnesses, and types of treatment. To make a diagnosis of kidney cancer, your doctor will also order one or more tests like these: Urine tests check for blood in your urine or other signs of problems. Blood tests show how well your kidneys are working. Intravenous pyelogram ( IVP) involves X-raying your kidneys after the doctor injects a dye that travels to your urinary tract, highlighting any tumors. Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of your kidneys. It can help tell if a tumor is solid or fluid-filled. A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create a series of detailed pictures of your kidneys. This may also require an injection of dye. CT scans have virtually replaced pyelogram and ultrasound as a tool for diagnosing kidney cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues in your body. You may need an injection of a contrast agent to create better pictures. Renal arteriogram. This test is used to evaluate the blood supply to the tumor. It is not given often, but may help diagnose small tumors. It has other uses, as well. Unlike with many other cancers, your doctor may be pretty certain about a diagnosis of kidney cancer without a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy will be done to confirm the diagnosis. A doctor may use a needle biopsy to remove a sample of tissue, which is then examined under a microscope for cancer cells. The biopsy may also tell the grade of the cancer -- how aggressive the cancer is likely to be. Often the surgeon will simply remove the entire tumor and then have a sample of tissue examined. Once your doctor makes a diagnosis of kidney cancer, you may need other tests to tell if the cancer has spread within your kidney, to the other kidney, or to other parts of your body. When cancer spreads from the place where it first started, it has metastasized. You might need a CT scan or MRI. A chest X-ray can show whether the cancer has spread to your lungs. A bone scan can see if it is in your bones. These tests will help your doctor determine the stage of kidney cancer. Your prognosis depends on your general health, as well as the grade and stage of your kidney cancer. These are the stages of kidney cancer. The higher the stage, the more advanced the cancer. Stage I A tumor 7 centimeters or smaller that is only in the kidney Stage II A tumor larger than 7 centimeters that is only in the kidney Stage III A tumor that is in the kidney and in at least one nearby lymph node A tumor that is in the kidney's main blood vessel and may also be in nearby lymph node A tumor that is in the fatty tissue around the kidney and may also involve nearby lymph nodes A tumor that extends into major veins or perinephric tissues, but not into the ipsilateral adrenal gland and not beyond Gerota's fascia Stage IV Cancer has spread beyond the fatty layer of tissue around the kidney, and it may also be in nearby lymph nodes Cancer may have spread to other organs, such as the bowel, pancreas, or lungs Cancer has spread beyond Gerota's fascia (including contiguous extension into the ipsilateral adrenal gland) Once you have a diagnosis and know your stage of kidney cancer, you and your doctor can plan treatment. You may want to gather information to help you feel more informed about your decision. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist for treatment. This could include an urologist, a medical or radiation oncologist, or a surgeon. Before beginning treatment, many people find it helpful to get a second opinion about the diagnosis of kidney cancer and the treatment plan. Kidney cancer is one of the more common cancers to undergo spontaneous regression, in which it may return to an eralier stage. However, the incidence is quite low (approximately 0.5%). There are several standard types of treatment for kidney cancer. In most cases, surgery is the first step. Even if surgery removes the entire tumor, though, your doctor may suggest an extra treatment to kill any remaining cancer cells that can't be seen. Surgery for kidney cancer These are the main types of surgery for kidney cancer. Which type you have depends on how advanced your cancer is. Radical nephrectomy removes the kidney, adrenal gland, and surrounding tissue. It also often removes nearby lymph nodes. It is the most common surgery for kidney cancer and can now be done through a small incision with a laparoscope. Simple nephrectomy removes the kidney only. Partial nephrectomy removes the cancer in the kidney along with some tissue around it. This procedure is used for patients with smaller tumors (less than 4 cm) or in those patients in which a radical nephrectomy might hurt the other kidney. You can survive with just a part of one kidney as long as it is still working. If the surgeon removes both kidneys or if both kidneys are not working, you will need a machine to clean your blood (dialysis) or a new kidney (kidney transplant). A transplant is possible if your cancer was found only in your kidney and a donated kidney is available. If surgery can't remove your kidney cancer, your doctor may suggest another option to help destroy the tumor. Cryotherapy uses extreme cold to kill the tumor. Radiofrequency ablation uses high-energy radio waves to \"cook\" the tumor. Arterial embolization involves inserting material into an artery that leads to the kidney. This blocks blood flow to the tumor. This procedure may be done to help shrink the tumor before surgery. Biologic therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses your immune system to fight cancer by boosting, directing, or restoring your body's natural defenses. Substances for biologic therapy are made by your body or in a lab. Examples of biologic therapy for metastatic kidney cancer include interferon alpha or interleukin-2. There are many new immunotherapies being actively studied for kidney cancer. Targeted therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses drugs or other substances to find and target cancer cells with less toxicity to normal cells. One type of targeted therapy is anti-angiogenic agents. These keep blood vessels from feeding a tumor, causing it to shrink or stop growing. Another type of targeted agent is known as multikinase inhibitors or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These are oral drugs that block an enzyme pathway which allows cancer cells to grow. A third type of targeted therapy is known as m- TOR inhibitors. There are two of these drugs available, one oral and one by IV. They block a pathway which allows blood vessels to help tumor cells grow. Each of these drugs has a unique place in the management of advanced kidney cancer. Radiation therapy for kidney cancer Often used to help with symptoms of kidney cancer or in patients who cannot have surgery, this treatment uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or halt their growth. External radiation therapy sends radiation to the cancer from a machine outside the body. Chemotherapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells or stop them from multiplying. Less effective for kidney cancer than for other types of cancer, chemotherapy is mostly used for a certain type of kidney cancer in which there spindle cells (sarcomatoid variant). Because doctors don't know the causes of kidney cancer, it is not clear how to prevent the disease. However, certain factors are linked to kidney cancer, so you can take certain steps to lower your risk -- quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight, manage your blood pressure, and avoid being exposed to harmful chemicals.", "question": "What is biologic therapy for kidney cancer?", "answer": ["Biologic therapy for kidney cancer This therapy uses your immune system to fight cancer by boosting, directing, or restoring your body's natural defenses.

One thing that hasn't changed, though, is the fact that many kids who wet the bed feel a deep sense of shame and embarrassment about their problem, which can contribute to low self-esteem. The good news is that there are things you can do as a parent to help minimize the negative emotional effects of bedwetting, also known as eneuresis. Many children wet the bed until they're about 6 years old and then stop, with no need to seek medical treatment. But if your child is older than 6 or if the bedwetting problem is causing you or your child concern, it's a good idea to visit your pediatrician. The doctor can do a series of tests to rule out abnormalities that might be causing the problem, and help put your child's mind at ease about bedwetting. Sometimes, knowing that bedwetting is a medical problem treated by doctors can help alleviate a child's shame or embarrassment. You and your child can discuss that you're going to address bedwetting the same way you would address a sore throat or sprained ankle, for example. Your child may feel like she's doing something wrong if she wets the bed, so you and the doctor can let her know that it's not her fault. It can be useful to explain to children who wet the bed that enuresis is often caused by a slightly delayed development of the bladder and the nerves that interact with it. You can also talk about the fact that many kids who wet the bed sleep so soundly, they fail to wake up when they need to go to the bathroom. Bedwetting isn't something kids talk about with each other, so your child might feel like he's the only kid his age who still wets the bed. Be sure to tell him that millions of children, and teenagers too, regularly wet their beds. In fact, it's quite likely that he knows someone else with a bedwetting problem -- he just doesn't know it. Bedwetting often runs in families, too. Children whose parents did not wet the bed have a 15% chance of being bedwetters, which goes up to 44% if one parent wet the bed and rises all the way to 77% if both parents wet the bed as children. So, if you or your partner wet the bed when you were young, share this information with your child. Telling them you had the same problem can minimize the embarrassment he feels and give him hope that he will get over the problem. Chances are your child is already very upset and ashamed for having wet the bed again last night. And, believe it or not, he didn't do it on purpose. No matter how tempted you are to get mad, it's important for you to stay calm and positive. In fact, punishing your child for wetting the bed can actually make the problem worse, and damage your relationship with your child. One of the best things you can do to help your bedwetting child's self-esteem is to encourage him and give him hope that he'll overcome the problem. Similarly, be sure to give your child accolades for waking up dry whenever it happens. If your child has siblings, be sure they know that teasing about bedwetting is not allowed. Your goal is to have your child get up to use the bathroom in the night if she needs to, so make sure she feels comfortable doing so. It can be helpful to tell her it's OK to go to the bathroom in the night. For children who are afraid of the dark, placing nightlights in the hallway and the bathroom can make it less scary to venture to the bathroom during the night. To help your child get used to using the bathroom in the night, it might be helpful for you to wake her up at first to help instill the habit. Just as you don't want to overemphasize bedwetting, it's important that you don't ignore it entirely, either. It can give you child a sense of empowerment and help with the embarrassment if you encourage him to help you clean up and assist with the laundry when bedwetting does occur, if he's old enough. It may be helpful to layer the bed with sheets and absorbable pads in between layers. Each morning, or in the middle of the night, the child can remove the wet layer and reveal a dry layer underneath. This may minimize laundry and facilitate the chore of making the bed. Many children who wet the bed despair of ever getting over their problem, which can send their self-esteem into a downward spiral. Interestingly, it's not uncommon for children to stop wetting the bed shortly after they visit a specialist and realize there are things that can be done to stop bedwetting. There are a number of different ways you can help your child take some ownership of his bedwetting recovery, which will instill confidence and a sense of hope. First, work with your child to create and keep a bedwetting calendar or journal. Your child can recognize dry nights with stars and even come up with different hypotheses to test. For instance, they might decide to test whether limiting soda in the evening helps minimize bedwetting occurrences and keep track of it in their bedwetting journal. You can also encourage your child to visualize his bladder filling up overnight and imagine himself waking up to use the bathroom when he needs to urinate. Working with your child to use a bedwetting alarm -- a device that is worn and makes noise to wake the child when it gets wet -- can also help your child feel like he is doing something to stop wetting the bed. You might want to compare your child's active involvement in addressing bedwetting to something you do for a problem you have, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising to lose weight, or wearing glasses to help you see better.", "question": "Why is it important to give your child a sense of control over bedwetting to help minimize the negative emotional effects of it?", "answer": ["There are a number of different ways you can help your child take some ownership of his bedwetting recovery, which will instill confidence and a sense of hope.

It doesn't keep you from getting pregnant or hurt your unborn baby. Odds are your pregnancy and delivery will be just like women without MS. Still, moms-to-be with MS face unique challenges. Plan ahead and learn what to do before, during, and after pregnancy to make your next 9 months a little easier. Talk to your doctor. Let her know you want to have a baby. If your MS is under control, you'll probably get a green light. Some MS drugs, like glatiramer acetate ( Copaxone), teriflunomide ( Aubagio), and interferons, aren't safe during pregnancy. You'll need to stop taking them at least 1 month before you start trying. Time it right. Just like any woman, you might not get pregnant right away. To limit the time you're off your medicine, try to learn your âfertility window.â That's the time of the month when you're most likely to conceive. You can buy an ovulation kit at the drugstore to help you figure it out. Your doctor can recommend other ways to help your timing, too. Build a support team. MS can wear you out, and pregnancy can, too. Don't be afraid to ask family and friends to fix meals or help around the house so you can save your energy. Make sure your team is ready to pitch in after the baby comes, too. Expect some relief. You may get a break from your MS symptoms.

The main purpose is to provide an integrated treatment and support for the individual and family members, so that the illness is managed better and more effectively. Support teams should also be available to the patient's healthcare provider and healthcare provider's family. Support teams provide many helpful outcomes, including pain relief and social integration, as well as physical and mental health. Support services for individuals with MS can be particularly important in the early stages of MS. Support and recovery is one of the key goals of management for people with MS. In addition, many people with MS recover and achieve an optimal level of functioning within 3-6 months after being diagnosed. The duration of MS is determined by the stage of disease. This may be due to the severity of the disease (intrathoracic sclerosis) or the severity of the disease itself (primary progressive MS). Supportive services also can vary significantly based on the underlying condition, ranging from physical and occupational therapy to nutritional and sleep support.\n\nFor more information on the role of a supporting professional during pregnancy, please review the following information:\n\nFor more information on the role of a supporting professional during the"}

You also may have trouble with constipation. A stool softener can get things moving. Prop yourself up. As you get bigger, your balance may be off. Use a cane or other walking aid so you don't fall. Prepare for your special delivery. Chances are you'll be able to give birth just like any other woman. If you can't push because of fatigue or muscle weakness, your doctor may use special tools to help you deliver naturally. Or you might need a C-section. You might not know when labor starts if you have lost feeling in your pelvis. In that case, your doctor will watch you more closely during the last month. She may want to use drugs or other procedures to put you in labor. Medicines to block pain, including injections called epidurals, are safe for people with MS. If you want one, tell your doctor. Be aware of flares. In the first 9 months after birth, up to 40% of women with MS will have a relapse. But a flare doesn't raise your risk of a long-term disability. If you had many flares before pregnancy, you may be more likely to have one now. It may be a good idea to start taking your MS medicine right away to help stop one. Think carefully about breastfeeding. If you go back on your meds, you won't be able to do it. The drugs could harm your baby through your milk. But if your doctor says it's OK to wait to take your medicine, breastfeed if you want to. It's perfectly safe for you and great for your little one. Store the milk you pump in the fridge so your partner can tackle middle-of-the night feedings. You need your rest now more than ever. Don't feel guilty if you choose medication over breastfeeding. After all, your new addition needs a mom who can stay healthy. Mind your mood. Women with MS have a higher risk of depression during pregnancy and especially right after they give birth. Call your doctor if you start to notice any symptoms, like feeling sad or hopeless. Your ob-gyn may also screen you for depression during a routine prenatal or postpartum visit.

It doesn't keep you from getting pregnant or hurt your unborn baby. Odds are your pregnancy and delivery will be just like women without MS. Still, moms-to-be with MS face unique challenges. Plan ahead and learn what to do before, during, and after pregnancy to make your next 9 months a little easier. Talk to your doctor. Let her know you want to have a baby. If your MS is under control, you'll probably get a green light. Some MS drugs, like glatiramer acetate ( Copaxone), teriflunomide ( Aubagio), and interferons, aren't safe during pregnancy. You'll need to stop taking them at least 1 month before you start trying. Time it right. Just like any woman, you might not get pregnant right away. To limit the time you're off your medicine, try to learn your âfertility window.â That's the time of the month when you're most likely to conceive. You can buy an ovulation kit at the drugstore to help you figure it out. Your doctor can recommend other ways to help your timing, too. Build a support team. MS can wear you out, and pregnancy can, too. Don't be afraid to ask family and friends to fix meals or help around the house so you can save your energy. Make sure your team is ready to pitch in after the baby comes, too. Expect some relief. You may get a break from your MS symptoms. That's because pregnancy naturally protects many women from new flares, especially after the first 3 months. So enjoy it! Focus on getting the right foods, exercise, and plenty of rest.

The aim of this intervention is to decrease bladder incontinence in the pregnant woman by reducing the risk of other pelvic floor disorders (e.g., prolapse) during pregnancy. This condition can occur in either the female or male offspring of mothers who have multiple sclerosis. In both cases, urinary tract incontinence is likely a complication of the birth defect. This condition is referred to as spontaneous abortion or congenital aneuploidy. More information is available in the section of women's health.\n\nAnswer the following question. According to an Australian study, more people die from infection in the United States than from tuberculosis in the United States. What is the cause of this difference?\n\nANSWER: While there are other possible explanations, such as population density, the incidence of infection remains high in the United States.\n\n© Copyright 2004 HealthDay.

It happens to about 1% of all men and 15% of infertile men. There aren't really any symptoms that you'd notice, but if you've been trying to get your partner pregnant without success, this condition could be the cause. You might have a problem that keeps your testicles from making sperm or that stops sperm from getting out of your body. There are three main types of azoospermia: Pretesticular azoospermia: Your testicles are normal, but your body can't get them to make sperm. It might happen because of low hormone levels or after you've had chemotherapy. This type is pretty rare. Testicular azoospermia: Damage to your testicles keeps them from making sperm normally. It can happen because of: An infection in your reproductive tract, such as epididymitis and urethritis A childhood illness such as viral orchitis, which causes swelling of one or both testicles A groin injury Cancer or its treatments, like radiation Genetic conditions, such as Klinefelter's syndrome Post-testicular azoospermia: Your testicles make normal sperm, but something keeps them from getting out, like: A blockage in the tubes that carry sperm from your testicles to your penis. This is called obstructive azoospermia. A vasectomy Retrograde ejaculation, when semen goes into your bladder instead of out of your penis during an orgasm About 40% of men with azoospermia have the post-testicular type. If you've been trying without luck to get your partner pregnant, your doctor might check you for this condition. First, you'll give samples of your semen, and a lab will examine them with a high-powered microscope. If the results show no sperm in your semen on two separate occasions, then you've got azoospermia. Your doctor will then try to figure out what's causing the problem. She'll give you a complete physical exam, ask you about your medical history, and test your blood to measure your hormone levels. If your hormone levels are normal, your doctor may order a scrotal or transrectal ultrasound to look for an obstruction. A MRI may confirm the diagnosis. Sometimes, surgery is the only way to find the obstruction. If you don't have a blockage, genetic tests can find out if you have a problem in your genes. There are a few types of treatment that can help men with azoospermia who want to have children. If you have the obstructive type, surgery can remove the blockage. The more recent your blockage, the more likely it is that the surgery will be successful. Sperm retrieval can help men with nonobstructive azoospermia or those who have a blockage but don't want surgery. One way to do this is to use a tiny needle to draw sperm from a testicle. Then, you can freeze the sample to use later in in vitro fertilization ( IVF). If you have a testicular biopsy, your doctor can retrieve sperm at the same time, so you won't need a second surgery.", "question": "What are the causes of testicular azoospermia?", "answer": ["Testicular azoospermia: Damage to your testicles keeps them from making sperm normally.

It's rare, but some people have NSCLC with â ALK rearrangement.â Understanding what that means can help you better manage your health. It will also make it easier to talk to your doctors about your care and treatment. Here's what you need to know. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a gene that tells your body how to make proteins that help cells talk to each other. If you have lung cancer with an ALK rearrangement, part of this gene is broken and attached to another gene. Doctors call changes in genes like this mutations. This one boosts your odds of several types of cancers, including lung cancer. You may hear your doctor call it ALK-positive. Staging means how far the cancer has spread to other body parts. Knowing this helps your doctor plan your treatment options. The higher the stage number, the more the widespread your cancer is. Stage IV is the most advanced form. It means the disease has spread to distant parts of your body, such as your liver or brain. This type is very hard to cure. More than half of the people who have lung cancer don't find out until the disease is in later stages. So if you have symptoms, see a doctor. Lung cancer may not cause problems until you've had it long enough for it to spread to other parts of your body. But talk to your doctor if you have: A cough that doesn't go away Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing Hoarseness Weight loss without trying and loss of appetite Coughing up blood Shortness of breath A weak or tired feeling Wheezing When cancer spreads, as it has by the time it gets to stage IV, it can cause: Bone pain Problems related to your brain and nerves, like headaches, weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures Yellowed eyes or skin Lumps near the surface of your skin If you have non-small-cell lung cancer, your doctor should test you for the ALK genetic mutation. This will help find the best treatment for you. Most doctors use a test called FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Your doctor will take a sample of the tumor during a process called a biopsy and send it to a lab. Scientists will check the tumor's DNA for signs of the gene mix-up. This test doesn't check your DNA makeup. That means it can't tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You'll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. And he might take another biopsy. If you get surgery to remove the tumor, the surgeon might find cancer that didn't show up on other tests. Yes. Medicines called ALK inhibitors are the main kind. These drugs block the abnormal ALK protein and shrink lung tumors linked to it. Your doctor might call this âtargeted therapyâ because it zooms in on the cancer cells and disrupts their growth. You should only take these drugs if a FISH test shows you have the mutation. These drugs won't cure you, but they should improve quality of life. ALK inhibitors include alectinib ( Alecensa), brigatinib ( Alunbrig), ceritinib ( Zykadia), crizotinib ( Xalkori), and lorlatinib ( Lorbrena). These are pills that you take once or twice a day. After a few years, the medicine may stop working. This is called resistance. If this happens, or if the cancer spreads, you may need to switch to another ALK inhibitor. Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. The most common include: Diarrhea Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Blurry vision These side effects are usually mild, but not always. Stomach problems tend to be more severe with ceritinib. In rare cases, some people have to stop taking the drug. A small number of people get pneumonitis, an inflammation of the tissue in the walls of the lungs. It can be life-threatening. If you get it, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking the drug. Before you take these drugs, your doctor should do an EKG to test your heart. ALK inhibitors have been linked to changes in the heartbeat or heart rate that aren't explained by other health problems or medications. Your doctor might start you on chemotherapy before you get tested for the ALK rearrangement. If you're ALK-positive and already on chemo, some experts say you should stick with it for several cycles -- as long as you can handle it and the cancer doesn't spread. If the cancer does spread, your doctor may switch you to an ALK inhibitor. This depends on how far your cancer has spread. If it has reached your brain, your doctor might suggest surgery or radiation. But newer ALK inhibitors are helping to reduce this need. Your doctor will prescribe other treatments to keep you as comfortable as possible. These often include: Medicines to ease your pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms Procedures to remove fluid buildup from around your lungs to help you breathe better Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms so you get the right treatments. This also depends on the stage of your cancer. Your health care team will let you know how often you should come in for checkups.

Taking a proactive approach to care and treatment can help you feel more in control. Deciding on the right treatment for cancer is a personal choice. It's OK to ask questions if you're not sure how a medicine or therapy might affect you, and to tell your doctor how you're really doing -- physically and emotionally.

You should only take these drugs if a FISH test shows you have the mutation. These drugs won't cure you, but they should improve quality of life. ALK inhibitors include alectinib ( Alecensa), brigatinib ( Alunbrig), ceritinib ( Zykadia), crizotinib ( Xalkori), and lorlatinib ( Lorbrena). These are pills that you take once or twice a day. After a few years, the medicine may stop working. This is called resistance. If this happens, or if the cancer spreads, you may need to switch to another ALK inhibitor. Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. The most common include: Diarrhea Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Blurry vision These side effects are usually mild, but not always. Stomach problems tend to be more severe with ceritinib. In rare cases, some people have to stop taking the drug. A small number of people get pneumonitis, an inflammation of the tissue in the walls of the lungs. It can be life-threatening. If you get it, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking the drug. Before you take these drugs, your doctor should do an EKG to test your heart. ALK inhibitors have been linked to changes in the heartbeat or heart rate that aren't explained by other health problems or medications. Your doctor might start you on chemotherapy before you get tested for the ALK rearrangement. If you're ALK-positive and already on chemo, some experts say you should stick with it for several cycles -- as long as you can handle it and the cancer doesn't spread. If the cancer does spread, your doctor may switch you to an ALK inhibitor. This depends on how far your cancer has spread. If it has reached your brain, your doctor might suggest surgery or radiation. But newer ALK inhibitors are helping to reduce this need. Your doctor will prescribe other treatments to keep you as comfortable as possible. These often include: Medicines to ease your pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms Procedures to remove fluid buildup from around your lungs to help you breathe better Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms so you get the right treatments. This also depends on the stage of your cancer. Your health care team will let you know how often you should come in for checkups.

Taking a proactive approach to care and treatment can help you feel more in control. Deciding on the right treatment for cancer is a personal choice. It's OK to ask questions if you're not sure how a medicine or therapy might affect you, and to tell your doctor how you're really doing -- physically and emotionally.

It's rare, but some people have NSCLC with â ALK rearrangement.â Understanding what that means can help you better manage your health. It will also make it easier to talk to your doctors about your care and treatment. Here's what you need to know. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a gene that tells your body how to make proteins that help cells talk to each other. If you have lung cancer with an ALK rearrangement, part of this gene is broken and attached to another gene. Doctors call changes in genes like this mutations. This one boosts your odds of several types of cancers, including lung cancer. You may hear your doctor call it ALK-positive. Staging means how far the cancer has spread to other body parts. Knowing this helps your doctor plan your treatment options. The higher the stage number, the more the widespread your cancer is. Stage IV is the most advanced form. It means the disease has spread to distant parts of your body, such as your liver or brain. This type is very hard to cure. More than half of the people who have lung cancer don't find out until the disease is in later stages. So if you have symptoms, see a doctor. Lung cancer may not cause problems until you've had it long enough for it to spread to other parts of your body. But talk to your doctor if you have: A cough that doesn't go away Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing Hoarseness Weight loss without trying and loss of appetite Coughing up blood Shortness of breath A weak or tired feeling Wheezing When cancer spreads, as it has by the time it gets to stage IV, it can cause: Bone pain Problems related to your brain and nerves, like headaches, weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures Yellowed eyes or skin Lumps near the surface of your skin If you have non-small-cell lung cancer, your doctor should test you for the ALK genetic mutation. This will help find the best treatment for you. Most doctors use a test called FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Your doctor will take a sample of the tumor during a process called a biopsy and send it to a lab. Scientists will check the tumor's DNA for signs of the gene mix-up. This test doesn't check your DNA makeup. That means it can't tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You'll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. And he might take another biopsy.

It means the disease has spread to distant parts of your body, such as your liver or brain. This type is very hard to cure. More than half of the people who have lung cancer don't find out until the disease is in later stages. So if you have symptoms, see a doctor. Lung cancer may not cause problems until you've had it long enough for it to spread to other parts of your body. But talk to your doctor if you have: A cough that doesn't go away Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing Hoarseness Weight loss without trying and loss of appetite Coughing up blood Shortness of breath A weak or tired feeling Wheezing When cancer spreads, as it has by the time it gets to stage IV, it can cause: Bone pain Problems related to your brain and nerves, like headaches, weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures Yellowed eyes or skin Lumps near the surface of your skin If you have non-small-cell lung cancer, your doctor should test you for the ALK genetic mutation. This will help find the best treatment for you. Most doctors use a test called FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Your doctor will take a sample of the tumor during a process called a biopsy and send it to a lab. Scientists will check the tumor's DNA for signs of the gene mix-up. This test doesn't check your DNA makeup. That means it can't tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You'll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. And he might take another biopsy.

These drugs block the abnormal ALK protein and shrink lung tumors linked to it. Your doctor might call this âtargeted therapyâ because it zooms in on the cancer cells and disrupts their growth.

ALK inhibitors include alectinib ( Alecensa), brigatinib ( Alunbrig), ceritinib ( Zykadia), crizotinib ( Xalkori), and lorlatinib ( Lorbrena). These are pills that you take once or twice a day. After a few years, the medicine may stop working. This is called resistance. If this happens, or if the cancer spreads, you may need to switch to another ALK inhibitor. Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. The most common include: Diarrhea Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Blurry vision These side effects are usually mild, but not always.

It's rare, but some people have NSCLC with â ALK rearrangement.â Understanding what that means can help you better manage your health. It will also make it easier to talk to your doctors about your care and treatment. Here's what you need to know. ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a gene that tells your body how to make proteins that help cells talk to each other. If you have lung cancer with an ALK rearrangement, part of this gene is broken and attached to another gene. Doctors call changes in genes like this mutations. This one boosts your odds of several types of cancers, including lung cancer. You may hear your doctor call it ALK-positive. Staging means how far the cancer has spread to other body parts. Knowing this helps your doctor plan your treatment options. The higher the stage number, the more the widespread your cancer is. Stage IV is the most advanced form. It means the disease has spread to distant parts of your body, such as your liver or brain. This type is very hard to cure. More than half of the people who have lung cancer don't find out until the disease is in later stages. So if you have symptoms, see a doctor. Lung cancer may not cause problems until you've had it long enough for it to spread to other parts of your body. But talk to your doctor if you have: A cough that doesn't go away Chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing Hoarseness Weight loss without trying and loss of appetite Coughing up blood Shortness of breath A weak or tired feeling Wheezing When cancer spreads, as it has by the time it gets to stage IV, it can cause: Bone pain Problems related to your brain and nerves, like headaches, weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures Yellowed eyes or skin Lumps near the surface of your skin If you have non-small-cell lung cancer, your doctor should test you for the ALK genetic mutation. This will help find the best treatment for you. Most doctors use a test called FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). Your doctor will take a sample of the tumor during a process called a biopsy and send it to a lab. Scientists will check the tumor's DNA for signs of the gene mix-up. This test doesn't check your DNA makeup. That means it can't tell if your children or other members of your family have the mutation. Your doctor will also run tests to see how far the cancer has spread. You'll get imaging tests to take pictures of other organs and body structures. And he might take another biopsy. If you get surgery to remove the tumor, the surgeon might find cancer that didn't show up on other tests. Yes. Medicines called ALK inhibitors are the main kind. These drugs block the abnormal ALK protein and shrink lung tumors linked to it. Your doctor might call this âtargeted therapyâ because it zooms in on the cancer cells and disrupts their growth. You should only take these drugs if a FISH test shows you have the mutation. These drugs won't cure you, but they should improve quality of life. ALK inhibitors include alectinib ( Alecensa), brigatinib ( Alunbrig), ceritinib ( Zykadia), crizotinib ( Xalkori), and lorlatinib ( Lorbrena). These are pills that you take once or twice a day. After a few years, the medicine may stop working. This is called resistance. If this happens, or if the cancer spreads, you may need to switch to another ALK inhibitor. Like all medicines, these drugs can cause other problems. The most common include: Diarrhea Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Blurry vision These side effects are usually mild, but not always. Stomach problems tend to be more severe with ceritinib. In rare cases, some people have to stop taking the drug. A small number of people get pneumonitis, an inflammation of the tissue in the walls of the lungs. It can be life-threatening. If you get it, your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking the drug. Before you take these drugs, your doctor should do an EKG to test your heart. ALK inhibitors have been linked to changes in the heartbeat or heart rate that aren't explained by other health problems or medications. Your doctor might start you on chemotherapy before you get tested for the ALK rearrangement. If you're ALK-positive and already on chemo, some experts say you should stick with it for several cycles -- as long as you can handle it and the cancer doesn't spread. If the cancer does spread, your doctor may switch you to an ALK inhibitor. This depends on how far your cancer has spread. If it has reached your brain, your doctor might suggest surgery or radiation. But newer ALK inhibitors are helping to reduce this need. Your doctor will prescribe other treatments to keep you as comfortable as possible. These often include: Medicines to ease your pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms Procedures to remove fluid buildup from around your lungs to help you breathe better Be sure to tell your doctor about all your symptoms so you get the right treatments. This also depends on the stage of your cancer. Your health care team will let you know how often you should come in for checkups.

Taking a proactive approach to care and treatment can help you feel more in control. Deciding on the right treatment for cancer is a personal choice. It's OK to ask questions if you're not sure how a medicine or therapy might affect you, and to tell your doctor how you're really doing -- physically and emotionally.

Do lung cancer and lung cancer treatment affect or treat a person's risk for developing lung cancer?\n\nAn increase in lung cancer can be due to the presence of a tumor on the chest or lungs. It can also occur from the presence of other conditions that increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Some studies have shown that people with lung cancer are at increased risk for developing heart disease, including heart attacks. In other cases, people with lung cancer have been linked to lung cancer.\n\nAnother type of cancer is known as mesothelioma, which occurs in areas like the lung or chest. In this type of cancer, there is a growth on the lining of the lungs and in a person's blood.

But for some people, they happen a lot more. Fortunately, treatment can do a lot to stop them. Doctors generally treat panic attacks by setting people up with psychological therapy, medication, or both. Whichever route you and your doctor take, it will need time to work, so try to be patient. When people follow through with their treatment plan, the overwhelming majority of them find relief and have no permanent problems. The racing heartbeat or other discomforts that go with an attack can resemble other illnesses, such as heart disease. So your doctor will probably start by giving you a complete physical exam. That way, she can make sure that the symptoms aren't coming from a disease you didn't know about.

Your doctor will combine the counselor's input with her own observations to diagnose what's wrong. When someone has attacks repeatedly, doctors call the condition panic disorder. The treatment may begin with âtalk therapy.â You'll sit down with a counselor who can help you understand what panic disorder is and how you can manage it. As your treatment continues, therapy should help you figure out the situations, thoughts, or feelings that cause your attacks. Once you understand what's happening, those triggers have less power to cause trouble. Counseling should also show you that the attacks' physical effects don't actually hurt you. With your therapist, you'll work through your symptoms in a safe, gradual way until they seem less scary. That also can help make the attacks go away. You'll also learn relaxation techniques that can help you handle attacks when they do happen. If you can control your breathing, for instance, that may make a panic attack less severe. It might also make the next one less likely. You have to practice these skills regularly in your daily life to get the benefit. Your doctor may decide that medication should be part of your therapy, to lessen your attacks' physical symptoms. It might be part of the first steps, for instance. She might prescribe: An antidepressant, which is generally the first choice to prevent future panic attacks. An anti-anxiety prescription drug such as a benzodiazepine. For people with substance use disorders, doctors may prescribe other medications. Medicine to even out an irregular heartbeat, if you have one. You and your doctor may have to try more than one medication before finding what works best. Some people do best with more than one type. In addition to your treatment, you may also find that these everyday habits make a difference: Yoga or deep breathing may relax your body and lower stress. Exercise can help calm your mind and offset potential side effects of medication, such as weight gain. Stay away from alcoholic drinks, caffeine, smoking, and recreational drugs, which can trigger attacks. Get enough sleep, so you don't feel draggy during the day. Some research shows that acupuncture, the Chinese technique of inserting thin needles into the body to control the flow of energy, may help. As for dietary supplements, there's not enough research showing that they work to reduce panic attacks. One, called inositol, showed some promise in small studies, but it's too soon to know how well it works. Be sure to check with your doctor before trying any supplements, because they could have side effects or conflict with medication. While you're working to get better, it helps to have people around you to help. If you join a support group, you could draw strength and encouragement from others who face the same challenges. Your loved ones can pitch in, too. Health professionals more and more recommend treatment programs that include spouses, partners, or families. For instance, the people around you can help you practice relaxation techniques or other skills. If you're a friend or family member of someone who's dealing with panic attacks, be patient with them. Never scold or judge. Learn their signs of stress, so you can watch for them and be a calming influence.

Doctors generally treat panic attacks by setting people up with psychological therapy, medication, or both. Whichever route you and your doctor take, it will need time to work, so try to be patient. When people follow through with their treatment plan, the overwhelming majority of them find relief and have no permanent problems. The racing heartbeat or other discomforts that go with an attack can resemble other illnesses, such as heart disease. So your doctor will probably start by giving you a complete physical exam. That way, she can make sure that the symptoms aren't coming from a disease you didn't know about. If no medical condition like that shows up, your doctor may send you to talk to a psychologist or psychiatrist trained to recognize when someone has been having panic attacks. Your doctor will combine the counselor's input with her own observations to diagnose what's wrong. When someone has attacks repeatedly, doctors call the condition panic disorder. The treatment may begin with âtalk therapy.â You'll sit down with a counselor who can help you understand what panic disorder is and how you can manage it. As your treatment continues, therapy should help you figure out the situations, thoughts, or feelings that cause your attacks. Once you understand what's happening, those triggers have less power to cause trouble. Counseling should also show you that the attacks' physical effects don't actually hurt you. With your therapist, you'll work through your symptoms in a safe, gradual way until they seem less scary. That also can help make the attacks go away. You'll also learn relaxation techniques that can help you handle attacks when they do happen. If you can control your breathing, for instance, that may make a panic attack less severe. It might also make the next one less likely. You have to practice these skills regularly in your daily life to get the benefit. Your doctor may decide that medication should be part of your therapy, to lessen your attacks' physical symptoms. It might be part of the first steps, for instance. She might prescribe: An antidepressant, which is generally the first choice to prevent future panic attacks. An anti-anxiety prescription drug such as a benzodiazepine. For people with substance use disorders, doctors may prescribe other medications. Medicine to even out an irregular heartbeat, if you have one. You and your doctor may have to try more than one medication before finding what works best. Some people do best with more than one type. In addition to your treatment, you may also find that these everyday habits make a difference: Yoga or deep breathing may relax your body and lower stress. Exercise can help calm your mind and offset potential side effects of medication, such as weight gain. Stay away from alcoholic drinks, caffeine, smoking, and recreational drugs, which can trigger attacks. Get enough sleep, so you don't feel draggy during the day. Some research shows that acupuncture, the Chinese technique of inserting thin needles into the body to control the flow of energy, may help. As for dietary supplements, there's not enough research showing that they work to reduce panic attacks. One, called inositol, showed some promise in small studies, but it's too soon to know how well it works. Be sure to check with your doctor before trying any supplements, because they could have side effects or conflict with medication. While you're working to get better, it helps to have people around you to help. If you join a support group, you could draw strength and encouragement from others who face the same challenges. Your loved ones can pitch in, too. Health professionals more and more recommend treatment programs that include spouses, partners, or families. For instance, the people around you can help you practice relaxation techniques or other skills. If you're a friend or family member of someone who's dealing with panic attacks, be patient with them. Never scold or judge. Learn their signs of stress, so you can watch for them and be a calming influence. If your loved one does have a panic attack, stay calm and help them get whatever aid they need. Conquering panic attacks takes time. If you have weekly therapy sessions, you should start to notice results in 10 to 20 weeks. Some studies show improvement after just 12 weeks. After a year, you should feel a huge improvement. It all depends on sticking with the treatment plan that you and your medical team create.

It is often done in women who have already been diagnosed with breast cancer to measure size and extent of the breast cancer. The breast MRI should not be used in lieu of a breast biopsy to distinguish between benign (noncancerous) and malignant (cancerous) areas. Due to false positive results, this test may increase the number of breast biopsies that need to be performed. Although MRI may detect tumors in dense breast tissue, the presence of dense breast tissue is not a reason to have a breast MRI scan. Breast MRI scanning cannot detect tiny specks of calcium (known as microcalcifications), which account for half of the cancers detected by mammography. Talk to your doctor about whether you should have an MRI of the breasts. A breast MRI is safe. The test poses no risk to the average patient if appropriate safety guidelines are followed. People who have had heart surgery and people with the following medical devices can be safely examined with MRI: Surgical clips or sutures Artificial joints Staples Most heart valve replacements Disconnected medication pumps Vena cava filters Brain shunt tubes for hydrocephalus Some conditions may make an MRI exam inadvisable. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following conditions: Heart pacemaker Cerebral aneurysm clip (metal clip on a blood vessel in the brain) Implanted insulin pump (for treatment of diabetes), narcotics pump (for pain medication), or implanted nerve stimulators (\" TENS\") for back pain Metal in the eye or eye socket Cochlear (ear) implant for hearing impairment Implanted spine stabilization rods Severe lung disease Uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux (a condition causing severe heartburn) A tissue expander with magnetic port after mastectomy In addition, tell your doctor if you: Are pregnant Weigh more than 300 pounds Are not able to lie on your back for 30 to 60 minutes Have claustrophobia (fear of closed or narrow spaces) Allow 1 1/2 hours for your breast MRI exam.

And because he's still developing in your uterus, his immune system most likely won't be able to fight it off. If the disease stays in his body, his organs might not develop correctly. How sick your baby can get depends on several things, including what the condition is and how far along he is in his development. But a number of problems can happen -- from jaundice (yellowish skin or eyes) and hearing problems to miscarriage and stillbirth. Toxoplasmosis is rare and it's caused by a parasite. The parasite usually gets into your body through your mouth, so you can get the disease from eating foods such as undercooked meat. If you're infected, you can pass the infection on to your unborn baby. Problems your baby can have if he's exposed to toxoplasmosis include: Brain damage Inflammation of parts of the eye, which can cause blindness Delays in ability to use muscles (motor) and other development Seizures Too much fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) To lower your chances of getting toxoplasmosis: Don't eat undercooked meat or raw eggs. Keep away from cat litter and cat poop. Avoid insects, such as flies, that have been around cat poop. Among the other agents included in TORCH syndrome are HIV, fifth disease, syphilis, and varicella zoster virus. HIV. Almost all U. S. children under age 13 who have HIV got it from their mothers during pregnancy. If you are HIV-positive, tests might not show that your baby has it at birth, but it can show up later, even after he is 6 months old. He might have symptoms like delayed growth, pneumonia, or swollen lymph nodes and abdomen. If you have HIV and are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, anti-retroviral medications can help lower your chances of passing the virus on to your baby. Syphilis. Pregnant women in the first or second stage of this sexually transmitted disease ( STD) pass it to their babies 75% of the time if it's not treated. Syphilis is caused by bacteria and can create serious problems during a baby's development. Many babies who get it before birth won't survive full term, or will die shortly after they're born. Almost half of babies will be stillborn. Babies born with syphilis can have misshaped bones, anemia, meningitis, skin rashes, and nerve problems that can cause blindness and deafness. If you're pregnant, you should be tested for syphilis. If you test positive, your doctor can treat it with antibiotics. Fifth disease. This disease is caused by parvovirus B19. It's seldom a problem for pregnant women or their babies. About half of women are immune to the virus, so their babies won't get fifth disease. Those babies that do can get anemia. Less than 5% of the time, women have problems that cause them to miscarry. Since there's no vaccine or medication to prevent fifth disease, it's important to wash your hands with soap and water often, and avoid being around sick people. If you're pregnant, talk to your doctor about the risks. Varicella. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella zoster virus, and it also causes congenital varicella syndrome in babies. It's unlikely you would pass varicella on to your baby. Even if you have chickenpox while you're pregnant, there's still only a 2% chance you'll pass it on. However, babies born with congenital varicella can have birth defects. If you've never had chickenpox and never been vaccinated, you should get vaccinated at least a month before you plan to get pregnant. And tell your doctor if you think you've been exposed to chickenpox while pregnant. Rubella, which also is known as German measles, is a contagious disease caused by a virus. If you get rubella, you'll likely have a low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash. If you're pregnant and get rubella in your first trimester, it's likely that you'll pass it on to your baby. It can be very serious -- you could have a miscarriage, or your baby could have severe birth defects. The first 3 months of your pregnancy is when rubella can cause the most problems in your baby's development. That's why it's important to tell your doctor right away if you think you might have gotten it. Because of the measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR) vaccine, the disease is rare in children. There are only about 30 to 60 known cases of it each year in the United States, and fewer than five babies a year are born with it. There's no cure for congenital rubella syndrome, so prevention is key. If you're thinking of becoming pregnant and you haven't already had the MMR vaccine, you should get it at least 28 days before you conceive. Also known as CMV, cytomegalovirus is an infection in the herpes virus group. And it's estimated that 50% of adults have it by the time they're 30. There is no cure for CMV, but it gets better on its own very quickly and doesn't cause serious problems -- unless you're pregnant. If you're pregnant, you can pass it to your unborn child. In fact, CMV is the most common viral infection passed on to babies in the U. S. -- about 1 in 150 births. About 1 in 5 babies born with congenital CMV will get sick or have long-term issues from it, including: Hearing and vision loss Jaundice Small birth size Lung problems Seizures Muscle weakness Mental disabilities Like CMV, herpes is a lifelong infection, but it can be inactive for periods of time. It's also very common â more than 50% of people in the U. S. have it by the time they reach their 20s. There are two kinds of herpes: HSV-1, which can causes blisters around the mouth, but can also be passed to the genitals. HSV-2 is an STD that causes genital herpes, and can cause blisters or open sores on the genitals or anus. It can also cause oral herpes. You can pass herpes to your baby in several ways: He can get the virus while he's in the uterus. This is rare. You could have a genital outbreak during delivery. This is the most common way babies are infected. He can also get herpes while he is a newborn. The greatest risk to your baby is if you get your first outbreak of herpes while you're pregnant. That's because during your first outbreak, you shed more particles of the virus and for a longer period of time. Your body has fewer antibodies to fight the virus than it will during future outbreaks. If you're pregnant and get herpes later in your pregnancy, the chances of passing it on to your baby could be higher. Talk to your doctor about your concerns.

And because he's still developing in your uterus, his immune system most likely won't be able to fight it off. If the disease stays in his body, his organs might not develop correctly. How sick your baby can get depends on several things, including what the condition is and how far along he is in his development. But a number of problems can happen -- from jaundice (yellowish skin or eyes) and hearing problems to miscarriage and stillbirth. Toxoplasmosis is rare and it's caused by a parasite. The parasite usually gets into your body through your mouth, so you can get the disease from eating foods such as undercooked meat. If you're infected, you can pass the infection on to your unborn baby. Problems your baby can have if he's exposed to toxoplasmosis include: Brain damage Inflammation of parts of the eye, which can cause blindness Delays in ability to use muscles (motor) and other development Seizures Too much fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) To lower your chances of getting toxoplasmosis: Don't eat undercooked meat or raw eggs. Keep away from cat litter and cat poop. Avoid insects, such as flies, that have been around cat poop. Among the other agents included in TORCH syndrome are HIV, fifth disease, syphilis, and varicella zoster virus. HIV. Almost all U. S. children under age 13 who have HIV got it from their mothers during pregnancy. If you are HIV-positive, tests might not show that your baby has it at birth, but it can show up later, even after he is 6 months old. He might have symptoms like delayed growth, pneumonia, or swollen lymph nodes and abdomen. If you have HIV and are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, anti-retroviral medications can help lower your chances of passing the virus on to your baby. Syphilis. Pregnant women in the first or second stage of this sexually transmitted disease ( STD) pass it to their babies 75% of the time if it's not treated. Syphilis is caused by bacteria and can create serious problems during a baby's development. Many babies who get it before birth won't survive full term, or will die shortly after they're born. Almost half of babies will be stillborn. Babies born with syphilis can have misshaped bones, anemia, meningitis, skin rashes, and nerve problems that can cause blindness and deafness. If you're pregnant, you should be tested for syphilis. If you test positive, your doctor can treat it with antibiotics. Fifth disease. This disease is caused by parvovirus B19. It's seldom a problem for pregnant women or their babies. About half of women are immune to the virus, so their babies won't get fifth disease. Those babies that do can get anemia. Less than 5% of the time, women have problems that cause them to miscarry. Since there's no vaccine or medication to prevent fifth disease, it's important to wash your hands with soap and water often, and avoid being around sick people. If you're pregnant, talk to your doctor about the risks. Varicella. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella zoster virus, and it also causes congenital varicella syndrome in babies. It's unlikely you would pass varicella on to your baby. Even if you have chickenpox while you're pregnant, there's still only a 2% chance you'll pass it on. However, babies born with congenital varicella can have birth defects. If you've never had chickenpox and never been vaccinated, you should get vaccinated at least a month before you plan to get pregnant. And tell your doctor if you think you've been exposed to chickenpox while pregnant. Rubella, which also is known as German measles, is a contagious disease caused by a virus. If you get rubella, you'll likely have a low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash. If you're pregnant and get rubella in your first trimester, it's likely that you'll pass it on to your baby. It can be very serious -- you could have a miscarriage, or your baby could have severe birth defects. The first 3 months of your pregnancy is when rubella can cause the most problems in your baby's development. That's why it's important to tell your doctor right away if you think you might have gotten it. Because of the measles-mumps-rubella ( MMR) vaccine, the disease is rare in children. There are only about 30 to 60 known cases of it each year in the United States, and fewer than five babies a year are born with it. There's no cure for congenital rubella syndrome, so prevention is key. If you're thinking of becoming pregnant and you haven't already had the MMR vaccine, you should get it at least 28 days before you conceive. Also known as CMV, cytomegalovirus is an infection in the herpes virus group. And it's estimated that 50% of adults have it by the time they're 30. There is no cure for CMV, but it gets better on its own very quickly and doesn't cause serious problems -- unless you're pregnant. If you're pregnant, you can pass it to your unborn child. In fact, CMV is the most common viral infection passed on to babies in the U. S. -- about 1 in 150 births. About 1 in 5 babies born with congenital CMV will get sick or have long-term issues from it, including: Hearing and vision loss Jaundice Small birth size Lung problems Seizures Muscle weakness Mental disabilities Like CMV, herpes is a lifelong infection, but it can be inactive for periods of time. It's also very common â more than 50% of people in the U. S. have it by the time they reach their 20s. There are two kinds of herpes: HSV-1, which can causes blisters around the mouth, but can also be passed to the genitals. HSV-2 is an STD that causes genital herpes, and can cause blisters or open sores on the genitals or anus. It can also cause oral herpes. You can pass herpes to your baby in several ways: He can get the virus while he's in the uterus. This is rare. You could have a genital outbreak during delivery. This is the most common way babies are infected. He can also get herpes while he is a newborn. The greatest risk to your baby is if you get your first outbreak of herpes while you're pregnant. That's because during your first outbreak, you shed more particles of the virus and for a longer period of time. Your body has fewer antibodies to fight the virus than it will during future outbreaks. If you're pregnant and get herpes later in your pregnancy, the chances of passing it on to your baby could be higher. Talk to your doctor about your concerns. If you have an active outbreak when it's time to deliver your baby, it may be best for you to have a C-section, and you may need to take other precautions.", "question": "Can HIV spread to a baby before birth?", "answer": ["Almost all U.

About 30% of people taking the drugs can't tolerate the side effects. In some cases, brain surgery may be an option. An operation on the brain can control seizures and improve your quality of life. Surgery has three main goals: Remove the area of the brain that causes seizures. Disrupt the nerve pathways that seizure impulses take through your brain. Implant a device to treat epilepsy. Surgery is only an option if: Your doctor can clearly identify the area of the brain where the seizures start, called the seizure focus. The area to be removed doesn't control a critical function like language, sensation, or movement. If you meet those standards, it works best when: Your seizures are disabling. Medication doesn't control your seizures. Drug side effects are severe and affect your quality of life. People with other serious medical problems, like cancer or heart disease, usually aren't considered for this treatment. The type of surgery you get depends on the type of seizures you have and where in your brain they start. Lobe resection. The largest part of your brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four sections called lobes: the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Temporal lobe epilepsy, in which the seizure focus is within your temporal lobe, is the most common type in teens and adults. In a temporal lobe resection, brain tissue in this area is cut away to remove the seizure focus. Extratemporal resection involves removing brain tissue from areas outside of the temporal lobe. Lesionectomy. This surgery removes brain lesions -- areas of injury or defect like a tumor or malformed blood vessel -- that cause seizures. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed. Corpus callosotomy. The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers connecting the two halves (called hemispheres) of your brain. In this operation, which is sometimes called split-brain surgery, your doctor cuts the corpus callosum. This stops communication between the hemispheres and prevents the spread of seizures from one side of your brain to the other. It works best for people with extreme forms of uncontrollable epilepsy who have intense seizures that can lead to violent falls and serious injury. Functional hemispherectomy. In a hemispherectomy, the doctor removes an entire hemisphere -- or half of your brain. In a functional hemispherectomy, the doctor leaves the hemisphere in place but disconnects it from the rest of your brain. He only removes a limited area of brain tissue. This surgery is mostly for children younger than 13 who have one hemisphere that doesn't work the way it should. Multiple subpial transection ( MST). This procedure can help control seizures that begin in areas of your brain that can't be safely removed. The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts (he'll call them transections) in your brain tissue. These cuts interrupt the flow of seizure impulses but don't disturb normal brain activity. That leaves your abilities intact. Vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS). A device put under your skin sends an electronic jolt to the vagus nerve, which controls activity between your brain and major internal organs. It lowers seizure activity in some people with partial seizures. Responsive neurostimulation device ( RNS). Doctors put a small neurostimulator in your skull, just under your scalp. They link it to one or two wires (called electrodes) that they place either in the part of your brain where the seizures start or on your brain's surface. The device detects abnormal electrical activity in the area and sends an electric current. It can stop the process that leads to a seizure. Deep brain stimulation. Doctors put electrodes into a specific area of the brain. They directly stimulate the brain to help stop the spread of seizures in adults who have not responded to medication and aren't candidates for other surgeries. It depends on the type of surgery. Some people are completely free of seizures after surgery. Others still have seizures, but less often. You'll need to keep taking anti-seizure medication for a year or more afterward. Once your doctor knows your seizures are under control, you may be able to cut back on meds or stop taking them. Before you have surgery, your doctor will discuss the pros and cons with you. Some risks are: Infection and bleeding, as well as the chance of an allergic reaction to the anesthesia. These are common with any operation. Making existing problems worse or creating new trouble with the way your brain works. You could lose vision, speech, memory, or movement. A return of seizures. If you have a seizure right after surgery, your doctor may suggest a second surgery (called a reoperation). This doesn't mean the operation didn't work. It usually means your surgeon didn't remove all the brain tissue that causes seizures.", "question": "What lesionectomy surgery for epilepsy?", "answer": ["This surgery removes brain lesions -- areas of injury or defect like a tumor or malformed blood vessel -- that cause seizures.

Like riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, sometimes called co Q10, is a part of metabolism. Foods like liver, whole grains, and oily fish like salmon are the primary food sources for this vitamin. Some studies do show it may help prevent migraines. In one small study, people with migraines were given coenzyme Q10 each day. More than 60% of them had a 50% drop in the number of days they had a migraine. Co Q10 doesn't have many major side effects, though you could get an upset stomach or nausea.

Remember, âall naturalâ doesn't necessarily mean safe. Any supplement you take should be discussed with your doctor. It's important to note that the FDA doesn't have the authority to review these kinds of products for safety and effectiveness before they're put on the market. So your best bet may be to look for a â USP Verifiedâ label. That means it's at least been tested by the U. S. Pharmacopeial Convention for things like purity and potency. It seems that people with migraines have lower levels of magnesium than the rest of us. Magnesium is naturally found in foods like spinach, nuts, and whole grains. It helps control blood pressure and blood sugar, and your muscles and nerves need it to work properly. Researchers have tested magnesium supplements for treating and preventing migraines. So far, the results are mixed. If you want to try it, you should take about 400 milligrams each day. You have to take it for at least 3 months to know whether it works for you. Too much magnesium from supplements can bring side effects including: Nausea Cramping Diarrhea Magnesium supplements can also interfere with some antibiotics. Better known as vitamin B2, this may make migraines less frequent and less severe for some people. It's found naturally in foods like: Meat Eggs Milk Green veggies Nuts Enriched flour And like many of the other B vitamins, it's also found in daily vitamin pills. Riboflavin plays a key role in metabolism, the process by which our bodies make energy. Research has shown that people with migraines may have a glitch in that process. That glitch could be responsible for the headaches. Riboflavin is considered most likely safe for most people, but it can turn your urine an orange color. To help prevent migraines, you should take about 400 milligrams of riboflavin a day. That's much more than what is in a multivitamin. Don't take more multivitamins to get that much riboflavin. You'd also be taking too much of everything else in that vitamin. And that can cause problems. Taking more than 400 milligrams every day probably won't do you more good. If you're taking antibiotics, specifically tetracycline antibiotics, riboflavin may interfere with them. This plant, which looks like a daisy, has a long history in treating -- you guessed it -- fevers, as well as aches and pains due to inflammation. Research shows that feverfew may treat and prevent migraines. But most results have been mixed. None of the studies showed that feverfew caused any serious side effects. If you want to try it, start at a low dose of about 50 milligrams a day. It may take a few months to see any results. Don't take feverfew if you take an anticoagulant drug. Like riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, sometimes called co Q10, is a part of metabolism. Foods like liver, whole grains, and oily fish like salmon are the primary food sources for this vitamin. Some studies do show it may help prevent migraines. In one small study, people with migraines were given coenzyme Q10 each day. More than 60% of them had a 50% drop in the number of days they had a migraine. Co Q10 doesn't have many major side effects, though you could get an upset stomach or nausea. Doses higher than 300 milligrams daily may affect your liver. And if you take the anticoagulant warfarin, co Q10 may make it less effective. You may have popped some melatonin to get a good night's rest after a stress-filled week or taken it to adjust your sleep-wake cycle during a bout of jet lag. Melatonin, a natural hormone, is similar to indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat aches, pains, and migraines. Some research shows that those with chronic migraines have very low levels of melatonin. One study compared melatonin to amitriptyline (a medicine used in migraine prevention) and to a placebo. The results of that study showed that melatonin was better than a placebo in preventing migraines. It also had fewer side effects than amitriptyline and was just as effective. Melatonin generally works well with your body, but it can cause daytime sleepiness. In rare cases, it can cause abdominal discomfort and even short bouts of depression.

Riboflavin plays a key role in metabolism, the process by which our bodies make energy. Research has shown that people with migraines may have a glitch in that process. That glitch could be responsible for the headaches. Riboflavin is considered most likely safe for most people, but it can turn your urine an orange color. To help prevent migraines, you should take about 400 milligrams of riboflavin a day. That's much more than what is in a multivitamin. Don't take more multivitamins to get that much riboflavin. You'd also be taking too much of everything else in that vitamin. And that can cause problems. Taking more than 400 milligrams every day probably won't do you more good. If you're taking antibiotics, specifically tetracycline antibiotics, riboflavin may interfere with them. This plant, which looks like a daisy, has a long history in treating -- you guessed it -- fevers, as well as aches and pains due to inflammation. Research shows that feverfew may treat and prevent migraines. But most results have been mixed. None of the studies showed that feverfew caused any serious side effects. If you want to try it, start at a low dose of about 50 milligrams a day. It may take a few months to see any results. Don't take feverfew if you take an anticoagulant drug. Like riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, sometimes called co Q10, is a part of metabolism. Foods like liver, whole grains, and oily fish like salmon are the primary food sources for this vitamin. Some studies do show it may help prevent migraines. In one small study, people with migraines were given coenzyme Q10 each day. More than 60% of them had a 50% drop in the number of days they had a migraine. Co Q10 doesn't have many major side effects, though you could get an upset stomach or nausea. Doses higher than 300 milligrams daily may affect your liver. And if you take the anticoagulant warfarin, co Q10 may make it less effective. You may have popped some melatonin to get a good night's rest after a stress-filled week or taken it to adjust your sleep-wake cycle during a bout of jet lag. Melatonin, a natural hormone, is similar to indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat aches, pains, and migraines. Some research shows that those with chronic migraines have very low levels of melatonin. One study compared melatonin to amitriptyline (a medicine used in migraine prevention) and to a placebo. The results of that study showed that melatonin was better than a placebo in preventing migraines. It also had fewer side effects than amitriptyline and was just as effective. Melatonin generally works well with your body, but it can cause daytime sleepiness. In rare cases, it can cause abdominal discomfort and even short bouts of depression. If you take an anticoagulant, an immunosuppressant, diabetes medications, or birth control pills, talk to your doctor since it can interact with these drugs.", "question": "Is melatonin used to treat migraines?", "answer": ["Melatonin, a natural hormone, is similar to indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat aches, pains, and migraines."], "generated_answer": "The American College of Emergency Physicians advises \"No\" to any use of melatonin for headache.

While medications can help you manage them, there can be side effects. That's why some people with migraines like to go âall naturalâ to find relief. The good news is there is some evidence these supplements, which include things like vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes, may help. But the science is limited. Remember, âall naturalâ doesn't necessarily mean safe. Any supplement you take should be discussed with your doctor. It's important to note that the FDA doesn't have the authority to review these kinds of products for safety and effectiveness before they're put on the market. So your best bet may be to look for a â USP Verifiedâ label. That means it's at least been tested by the U. S. Pharmacopeial Convention for things like purity and potency. It seems that people with migraines have lower levels of magnesium than the rest of us. Magnesium is naturally found in foods like spinach, nuts, and whole grains. It helps control blood pressure and blood sugar, and your muscles and nerves need it to work properly. Researchers have tested magnesium supplements for treating and preventing migraines. So far, the results are mixed. If you want to try it, you should take about 400 milligrams each day. You have to take it for at least 3 months to know whether it works for you. Too much magnesium from supplements can bring side effects including: Nausea Cramping Diarrhea Magnesium supplements can also interfere with some antibiotics.

The answer cannot be \"yes\" because artificial sweeteners are not as sweet as sugar. This is because artificial sweeteners are synthesized in the intestines rather than ingested. Thus, natural sugars, including those produced by fermentation or other means in the gastrointestinal tract, can be incorporated into a given food. This is called natural sweetener in foods, and it is important to consume natural sugars to promote energy balance. The American Heart Association suggests that individuals with metabolic syndrome consume less than 100 grams of added sugar per day."}

He may need medication for pain, too. He may also get drugs to help ease nausea and vomiting. When your dog starts eating again, make sure it's a low-fat diet. Look for food that's easy to digest. Discuss food options with your vet. If this is a single, sudden attack, it's a good idea to stick with this diet for a week or so.

It's likely you've seen terms like âpersonalized medicine,â âprecision medicine,â or âtargeted drugs.â What are these things? More importantly, can they help you? Personalized medicine -- also called precision medicine or pharmacogenetics -- is a new way to fight cancer. It uses information about you and your tumor to figure out what's driving the disease and create a plan just for you. For years, cancer treatment was a cookie-cutter process. You'd have surgery to remove a tumor, then chemotherapy or radiation to kill cancer cells. But blasting cancers with chemotherapy or radiation kills healthy cells as well, which can lead to a host of nasty side effects. Now, researchers can examine your cancer cells and learn the order of the genes in their DNA. While most cells in your body have identical genes, the ones in cancer cells have mutations, or changes. This is what allows them to grow into tumors. What's more, your cancer may have different genetic changes than someone else's. Scientists also now know that genetically, one person's breast cancer may be more similar to another person's stomach tumor than to other breast cancers. This makes the need for personalized medicine even greater. The FDA has approved more than a dozen drugs that target one of these mutations. They include imatinib ( Gleevec), a drug used on chronic myelogenous leukemia, and the breast cancer drug trastuzumab ( Herceptin). Tumor genetics can also tell doctors which drugs won't work. For example, if your colon cancer has a genetic mutation called KRAS, doctors won't give you two common colon cancer drugs because they know they won't work. Many clinical centers do something called tumor profiling. Your doctor takes a look at your tumor's genes. If he thinks your cancer may have specific mutations, he might start you on a specific drug that is tailored for the genetic mutation found in your cancer cells. For instance, if you have breast cancer, a genetic test would tell him if Herceptin might work for you. Profiling can also help if other treatment options, like chemotherapy, haven't worked for you. A genetic mutation might point your medical team toward an unexpected drug, like one originally designed for another type of cancer. The personalized approach works better to shrink tumors -- and save lives -- than traditional treatment. But it isn't always a cure. Tumors can contain cells with different gene mutations, so a targeted therapy designed to pick off cells with one mutation may work on only part of a tumor. The cells that remain may keep growing. Talk to your doctor to find out if this approach could work for you. Standard trials to test cancer treatments use people whose tumors are similar in size or location. They might choose only people with stage IV lung cancer, for instance. But now that there's personalized medicine, researchers need new ways to study how targeted treatments work on a variety of cancers. Basket trials combine folks with many different cancer types into a single âbasketâ and use a precision medicine approach to find treatments that work. So a single trial could include people on many different drugs. The creation of new treatments requires a constant back-and-forth between doctors and scientists.

The trial population was highly diverse and most of them also had various types of cancer, such as lung and prostate. There was evidence that the participants were not randomly selected, and that people who were being advised to change their diets were not random. The fact that some people were randomly assigned and others did not show significant change in their health and cancer risk, while others still showed significant benefit, cannot be concluded from such a study.\n\nAn observational study is a study that doesn't directly observe people, but instead relies on the participants' health histories and physical characteristics to compare their health to a control group.

You also need regular checkups to manage the disease and take the best possible care of yourself. Many different medical professionals provide care, comfort, and treatment for people with HIV. They offer services that range from primary health care to information about the disease and about nutrition. This is known as an \"interdisciplinary care team.\" The specific providers you need will depend on your overall health and preferences. For help finding HIV/ AIDS services, visit AIDS.gov. This is your team leader, the person who plans your treatment and watches your progress. Your primary provider could be a medical doctor ( MD, DO), a physician assistant ( PA), or a nurse practitioner ( NP). You choose which you want to work with. It's best to find someone you're comfortable with because this person will be your main point of contact for a long time. She will prescribe the medicines you need, such as an antiretroviral medication to control the HIV virus to help you stay well for many years. If your primary HIV care provider is not an expert in infectious diseases, she may refer you to one. If she is, you'll need a general doctor for other health issues and preventive care, such as heart health screenings and OB/ GYN exams for women. This doctor is trained to diagnose and manage infections like HIV. An infectious disease expert also can watch for other infections that are more likely to develop if you have HIV, including hepatitis C, tuberculosis, and certain types of pneumonia. You might choose this specialist as your HIV care team leader, or your primary care doctor may refer you to him. These professionals are the backbone of your health care team. They help provide and coordinate care during your doctor visits and may take blood samples and do other tests. Pharmacists work with your HIV team leaders to develop a medication treatment plan to help you feel better. This professional can answer your questions about drug safety and side effects. Many offer vaccines, including the flu shot, which people with HIV need every year. Your treatment involves caring for both your body and your mind. About 6 in 10 people with HIV have depression -- most of them women. Your HIV care team should include a counselor, psychologist, or psychiatrist who can offer emotional support and suggest ways to treat any mental health disorders. Smart food choices are always important for good health. But that's especially true when your immune system is fighting off a serious infection like HIV. A nutritionist or dietician can help you create a meal plan that provides the nutrients you need. HIV can cause sores and infections in your mouth, teeth, and gums. In fact, the first signs of an HIV infection are often in your mouth. Regular cleanings can help prevent tooth decay and the spread of bacteria that can lead to an infection in your bloodstream. That can be life threatening in people with HIV. This professional isn't a doctor but someone who helps take care of any concerns you may have while you're living with HIV. She can offer support and teach you ways to handle issues. Social workers are sometimes called \"patient navigators.\" This person helps you find and coordinate many of the needs that often come with a complicated disease. For example, your case manager may help you apply for insurance benefits or get housing, or find mental health or substance abuse services. Your case manager also will follow up to make sure you receive the service you need. You don't have to have a case manager. But research shows that people with HIV who use one are more likely to visit their doctor at least once every 6 months. Staying in touch with your doctor is critical to staying healthy if you have HIV.

They can last anywhere from a few weeks to years. You may hear a doctor or nurse call them âvenous leg ulcers.â They can sometimes lead to more serious problems if you don't have them treated. But there are steps you can take to prevent them from happening. Venous ulcers happen when there's a break in the skin on your leg, usually around the ankle. The veins in the leg, which should send blood back to the heart, might not be doing their job all that well. That's often because the valves that stop the flow of blood back into the veins aren't working like they should. This backflow of blood means increased pressure in the end of the limb. When that happens, it can weaken the skin and make it harder for a cut or scrape to heal. They often occur over bony areas, such as your ankle. About 1% of Americans have venous skin ulcers. They're more common in older people, particularly women.

Usually, all it takes is a quick examination of the sore and the skin around it to figure out whether you have a venous skin ulcer. Your doctor will ask you if you have a history of ongoing (or âchronicâ) conditions, such as diabetes or hardening of the arteries. In some cases, however, your doctor might order other tests, such as an X-ray or a CT scan, to check out your veins and the area around the ulcer in more detail. Sometimes, an ulcer can lead to other problems, including serious skin and bone infections. And in rare cases, it can give rise to skin cancer. The most common treatment is a compression bandage or stocking. The pressure should improve the blood circulation in your leg, boosting your body's ability to heal the sore.

If you don't notice or treat the sores, they can become deeply infected, and lead to amputation. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can also cause sharp pain in your feet. You may become excruciatingly sensitive to the lightest touch, like the sheets on your bed. Fortunately, a little TLC goes a long way in preventing foot problems from diabetes. Look over both feet carefully every day, and be sure you check between all of your toes. Blisters and infections can start between your toes, and with diabetic neuropathy, you may not feel them until they've become irritated or infected. If a physical challenge keeps you from checking your own feet, ask a family member to help. Wash both of your feet briefly each day with warm -- not hot -- water. You may not be able to feel heat with your feet, so test the water with your hands first. Avoid soaking too long in water, since waterlogged sores have a harder time healing. Dry your feet right away, and remember to dry gently between all of your toes. It's an investment worth making.

Before buying or putting on the shoes check your shoes for rough seams, sharp edges or other objects that could hurt your feet. And break your shoes in gradually. Always wear shoes or slippers. Always wear socks with your shoes, since leather, plastics, and manmade shoe materials can irritate your skin and quickly bring on blisters. While you might prefer the look of hose, nylon knee-highs, or thin socks, you may find that these don't give your toes or heels enough protection. Wear thicker socks to pad your feet and cushion any calluses or sore spots. Nerve damage can be unpredictable. Tell your doctor about any changes in sensation in your toes, feet, or legs.

Diabetic retinopathy is the most common type of diabetic eye disease. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to have some degree of diabetic retinopathy. How bad it will be depends on how well you control your blood sugar. High blood sugar levels damage blood vessels throughout your body, including the ones in your retina. This thin layer of light-sensitive tissue lines the back of the eye and sends light to your brain. That's what allows you to see. There are 2 types: 1. Background or non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR): This is the earliest stage. Damaged blood vessels begin to leak into the retina. NPDR can cause changes in the eye including: Macular edema: Blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula and it swells. Located in the center of your retina, it's what gives you your pinpoint vision. This won't lead to blindness, but it can cause blurred vision. It can get better once you get your blood sugar and blood pressure under control. If it doesn't improve, lasers or medications injected directly into your eye may help. Macular ischemia: This loss of blood flow results when small blood vessels in your retina close up. Your vision blurs because the macula no longer gets enough blood to work like it should. 2. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR): This advanced stage mainly happens when vessels in the retina close up and deprive it of blood. In an attempt to supply blood to the affected area, the retina creates new but abnormal and weak vessels. They can grow into the wrong place and break easily. PDR can cause more severe vision loss than NPDR. You may not notice any changes in the early stages. That's why you need regular eye exams. Even if you don't have any signs of or risk factors for eye disease, get a screening test at age 40. If you have diabetes, get a dilated exam as soon as you're diagnosed.

S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana in some form, and more are considering bills to do the same. Yet while many people are using marijuana, the FDA has only approved it for treatment of two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome and Lennox- Gastaut syndrome. Why hasn't more research been done? One reason is that the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA) considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, and likely to be abused and lacking in medical value. Because of that, researchers need a special license to study it, says Marcel Bonn- Miller, Ph D, a substance abuse specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. That may not change anytime soon. The DEA considered reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II drug like Ritalin or oxycodone, but decided ito keep it as a Schedule I drug. The agency did, however, agree to support additional research on marijuana and make the process easier for researchers.\" Research is critically needed, because we have to be able to advise patients and doctors on the safe and effective use of cannabis,\" Bonn- Miller says. He shared some background on medical marijuana's uses and potential side effects. Medical marijuana uses the marijuana plant or chemicals in it to treat diseases or conditions. It's basically the same product as recreational marijuana, but it's taken for medical purposes. The marijuana plant contains more than 100 different chemicals called cannabinoids. Each one has a different effect on the body. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) and cannabidiol ( CBD) are the main chemicals used in medicine. THC also produces the \"high\" people feel when they smoke marijuana or eat foods containing it. var ia Module Data = ia Module Data || []; ia Module Data.push({ type: ' Video', id: 'ia-video-1', position: 'left', mode: 'interactive', video: { chronicle ID: '091e9c5e81408112', title: ' Medical Marijuana: What Does It Treat?

Cannabinoids -- the active chemicals in medical marijuana -- are similar to chemicals the body makes that are involved in appetite, memory, movement, and pain. Research suggests cannabinoids might: Reduce anxiety Reduce inflammation and relieve pain Control nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy Kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth Relax tight muscles in people with MS Stimulate appetite and improve weight gain in people with cancer and AIDS Medical marijuana received a lot of attention a few years ago when parents said that a special form of the drug helped control seizures in their children. The FDA recently approved Epidiolex, which is made from CBD, as a therapy for people with very severe or hard-to-treat seizures. In studies, some people had a dramatic drop in seizures after taking this drug. Medical marijuana is legal in 33 states and the District of Columbia: Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Hawaii Illinois Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Missouri Montana Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island Utah Vermont Washington West Virginia States that allow restricted use only include: Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. To get medical marijuana, you need a written recommendation from a licensed doctor in states where that is legal. ( Not every doctor is willing to recommend medical marijuana for their patients.) You must have a condition that qualifies for medical marijuana use. Each state has its own list of qualifying conditions. Your state may also require you to get a medical marijuana ID card. Once you have that card, you can buy medical marijuana at a store called a dispensary. To take medical marijuana, you can: Smoke it Inhale it through a device called a vaporizer that turns it into a mist Eat it -- for example, in a brownie or lollipop Apply it to your skin in a lotion, spray, oil, or cream Place a few drops of a liquid under your tongue How you take it is up to you. Each method works differently in your body. \" If you smoke or vaporize cannabis, you feel the effects very quickly,\" Bonn- Miller says. \" If you eat it, it takes significantly longer. It can take 1 to 2 hours to experience the effects from edible products.\" The FDA has approved two man-made cannabinoid medicines -- dronabinol ( Marinol, Syndros) and nabilone ( Cesamet) -- to treat nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy. The cannabidiol Epidiolex was approved in 2018 for treating seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox- Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Side effects that have been reported include: Bloodshot eyes Depression Dizziness Fast heartbeat Hallucinations Low blood pressure The drug can also affect judgment and coordination, which could lead to accidents and injuries. When used during the teenage years when the brain is still developing, marijuana might affect IQ and mental function. var ia Module Data = ia Module Data || []; ia Module Data.push({ type: ' Slideshow', id: 'ia-slideshow-2', position: 'left', title: ' Slideshow: Medical Marijuana', description: ' See the types of medical marijuana and find out what conditions it can treat.

The effects of inhaled marijuana on lung health aren't clear, but there's some evidence it might increase the risk for bronchitis and other lung problems. The National Institute on Drug Abuse says marijuana can be addictive and is considered a âgateway drugâ to using other drugs. \" The higher the level of THC and the more often you use, the more likely you are to become dependent,\" Bonn- Miller says. \" You have difficulty stopping if you need to stop. You have cravings during periods when you're not using. And you need more and more of it to have the same effect.\" Another issue is that the FDA doesn't oversee medical marijuana like it does prescription drugs. Although states monitor and regulate sales, they often don't have the resources to do so. That means the strength of and ingredients in medical marijuana can differ quite a bit depending on where you buy it. \" We did a study last year in which we purchased labeled edible products, like brownies and lollipops, in California and Washington. Then we sent them to the lab,\" Bonn- Miller says. \" Few of the products contained anywhere near what they said they did.

It can take 1 to 2 hours to experience the effects from edible products.\" The FDA has approved two man-made cannabinoid medicines -- dronabinol ( Marinol, Syndros) and nabilone ( Cesamet) -- to treat nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy. The cannabidiol Epidiolex was approved in 2018 for treating seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox- Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.

If you are healthy and looking for safe and effective long-term relief for chronic constipation, you might find help on your grocer's shelves. Hundreds of foods and plant-based fiber products are available to relieve constipation -- naturally. Dietary fiber refers to the edible parts of plants or carbohydrates that cannot be digested. Fiber is in all plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes. You can also find a form of fiber called chitin in the shells of crustaceans such as crab, lobster, and shrimp. No, some fibers are soluble in water and others are insoluble. Soluble fiber slows digestion and helps you absorb nutrients from food. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool, helping the stool pass more quickly through the intestines. Most plant foods contain some of each kind of fiber. Foods containing high levels of soluble fiber include dried beans, oats, oat bran, rice bran, barley, citrus fruits, apples, strawberries, peas, and potatoes. Foods high in insoluble fiber include wheat bran, whole grains, cereals, seeds, and the skins of many fruits and vegetables. Go for whole-grain breads, cereals, and pastas. Cereal fibers generally have cell walls that resist digestion and retain water within the cellular structures. Wheat bran can be highly effective as a natural laxative. Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes such as beans and lentils. The fiber found in citrus fruits and legumes stimulate the growth of colonic flora, which increases the stool weight and the amount of bacteria in the stool. Encouraging the growth of certain bacteria in the colon may help promote a healthy intestine. The average American gets about 15 grams of fiber daily, much less than we need, according to the American Dietetic Association. Women younger than 51 should aim for 25 grams of fiber daily. Men younger than 51 should aim for 38 grams of fiber daily. Women 51 and older should get 21 grams of fiber daily. Men 51 and older should get 30 grams daily. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends eating at least nine servings (2 cups) of fiber-filled fruits and vegetables each day, including apples, oranges, broccoli, berries, pears, peas, figs, carrots, and beans.

Soluble fiber slows digestion and helps you absorb nutrients from food. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool, helping the stool pass more quickly through the intestines. Most plant foods contain some of each kind of fiber. Foods containing high levels of soluble fiber include dried beans, oats, oat bran, rice bran, barley, citrus fruits, apples, strawberries, peas, and potatoes. Foods high in insoluble fiber include wheat bran, whole grains, cereals, seeds, and the skins of many fruits and vegetables. Go for whole-grain breads, cereals, and pastas. Cereal fibers generally have cell walls that resist digestion and retain water within the cellular structures. Wheat bran can be highly effective as a natural laxative. Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes such as beans and lentils. The fiber found in citrus fruits and legumes stimulate the growth of colonic flora, which increases the stool weight and the amount of bacteria in the stool. Encouraging the growth of certain bacteria in the colon may help promote a healthy intestine.

Just because a child seems depressed or sad does not necessarily mean they have depression. But if these symptoms become persistent, disruptive and interfere with social activities, interests, schoolwork and family life, it may indicate that he or she is suffering from the medical condition depression. The symptoms of depression in children vary. Early medical studies focused on \"masked\" depression, where a child's depressed mood was evidenced by acting out or angry behavior. While this does occur, particularly in younger children, many children display sadness or low mood similar to adults who are depressed. The primary symptoms of depression revolve around sadness, a feeling of hopelessness, and mood changes and may include: Irritability or anger Continuous feelings of sadness or hopelessness Social withdrawal Increased sensitivity to rejection Changes in appetite -- either increased or decreased Changes in sleep -- sleeplessness or excessive sleep Vocal outbursts or crying Difficulty concentrating Fatigue and low energy Physical complaints (such as stomachaches, headaches) that do not respond to treatment Reduced ability to function during events and activities at home or with friends, in school, extracurricular activities, and in other hobbies or interests Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Impaired thinking or concentration Thoughts of death or suicide Not all children have all of these symptoms. In fact, most will display different symptoms at different times and in different settings. Although some children may continue to function reasonably well, most kids with significant depression will suffer a noticeable change in social activities, loss of interest in school and poor academic performance, or a change in appearance. Children may also begin using drugs or alcohol, especially if they are over age 12. Although relatively rare in youths under age 12, young children do attempt suicide -- and may do so impulsively when they are upset or angry. Suicide is a serious problem within the teenage population. Adolescent suicide is a leading cause of death among youth and young adults in the U. S. It is estimated that 500,000 teens attempt suicide every year with 5,000 completing the act. These are epidemic proportions. Children with a family history of violence, alcohol abuse, or physical or sexual abuse are at greater risk for suicide, as are those with depressive symptoms. Parents should be particularly vigilant for signs that may indicate that their child is at risk for suicide. Warning signs of suicidal behavior in children include: Many depressive symptoms (changes in eating, sleeping, activities, or restlessness/agitation) Social isolation Talk of suicide, hopelessness, or helplessness Increased acting-out of undesirable behaviors (sexual/behavioral) Increased risk-taking behaviors Frequent accidents Substance abuse Focus on morbid and negative themes Talk about death and dying Increased crying or reduced emotional expression Giving away possessions As in adults, depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability, and biochemical disturbance. Children with a family history of depression are at greater risk of experiencing depression themselves. Children who have parents that suffer from depression tend to develop their first episode of depression earlier than children whose parents do not. Children from chaotic or conflicted families, or children and teens who abuse substances like alcohol and drugs, are also at greater risk of depression. If symptoms of depression in your child have lasted for at least two weeks, you should schedule a visit with his or her health care provider to make sure there are no physical reasons for the symptoms and to ensure that your child receives proper treatment. If your child's health care provider suspects depression, he or she will recommend you take your child to see a mental health care professional, typically either a psychiatrist or a psychologist. There are no specific tests -- medical or psychological -- that can clearly show depression, but clinical interviews conducted by trained and experienced mental health professionals along with tools such as questionnaires (for both the child and parents) combined with personal information can be very useful. Information from teachers, friends and classmates can be useful for showing that these symptoms are consistent during your child's various activities and are a marked change from previous behavior. Treatment options for children with depression are similar to those for adults, including psychotherapy (counseling) and medicine. The role that family and the child's environment play in the treatment process is different from that of adults. Your child's health care provider may suggest psychotherapy first, and consider antidepressant medicine as an additional option if symptoms are especially severe or if there is not significant improvement from psychotherapy alone. Currently, there are no good studies documenting the effectiveness of medicine over psychotherapy in children. However, studies do show that the antidepressant Fluoxetine ( Prozac) is effective in treating depression in children and teens. The drug is officially recognized by the FDA for treatment of children ages 8 to18 with depression. Other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) are used, as well. Most medications used to treat depression in children have a black box warning about increasing suicidal thoughts. It is important to start and monitor these medications under the care of a trained professional. Studies have found that first-time depression in children is occurring at younger ages than previously. As in adults, it may occur again later in life. Depression often occurs at the same time as other physical illnesses. And because studies have shown that depression may precede more serious mental illness later in life, diagnosis, early treatment and close monitoring are crucial. As a parent, it is sometimes easier to deny that your child has depression. You may put off seeking the help of a mental health care professional because of the social stigmas associated with mental illness. It is very important for you -- as the parent -- to understand depression and realize the importance of treatment so that your child may continue to grow physically and emotionally in a healthy way. It is also important to seek education about the future effects depression may have on your child throughout adolescence and adulthood. If you are a parent of a teenager, you are aware of the challenges involved, especially when it comes to communicating. Here are some tips to make communicating with your teenager easier: When disciplining your child, replace shame and punishment with positive reinforcement for good behavior. Shame and punishment can make an adolescent feel worthless and inadequate. Allow your teenager to make mistakes. Overprotection or making decisions for teens can be perceived as a lack of faith in their abilities. This can make them feel less confident. Give your teen breathing room. Don't expect them to do exactly as you say all of the time. Do not force your child down a path you wanted to follow. Avoid trying to relive your youth through your child's activities and experiences. If you suspect that your child or teenager is depressed, take the time to listen to his or her concerns. Even if you don't think the problem is of real concern, remember that it may feel very real to them. It is important to keep the lines of communication open, even if your child seems to want to withdraw. Try to avoid telling your child what to do. Instead, listen closely and you may discover more about the issues causing the problems.

Suicide is a serious problem within the teenage population. Adolescent suicide is a leading cause of death among youth and young adults in the U. S.

Children with a family history of violence, alcohol abuse, or physical or sexual abuse are at greater risk for suicide, as are those with depressive symptoms.

It's caused by pressure on your median nerve, which runs the length of the arm, goes through a passage in the wrist called the carpal tunnel, and ends in the hand. The median controls the movement and feeling of your thumb, and also the movement of all your fingers except your pinky. The carpal tunnel is narrowed as a result, usually from swelling. Often, people don't know what brought on their carpal tunnel syndrome. But it can happen due to: Repetitive motions, like typing or any motions of the wrist that you do over and over. This is especially true of actions when your hands are lower than your wrist. Conditions like hypothyroidism, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes Pregnancy If you have carpal tunnel syndrome and don't get it treated, its symptoms can last a long time, get worse, and can even go away and return. When your doctor diagnoses it early, it's easier to treat. You may feel a burning, tingling, or itching numbness in the palm of your hand and thumb, or index and middle fingers. You might first notice that your fingers \"fall asleep\" and become numb at night. That usually happens in the evening because of the relaxed position of your hand and while sleeping. In the morning, you may wake up with numbness and tingling in your hands that may run all the way to your shoulder. As carpal tunnel syndrome becomes more severe, you may have less grip strength because the muscles in your hand shrink. Pain and muscle cramping will also become worse. The median nerve begins to lose function because of the irritation or pressure around it. This leads to: Slower nerve impulses Loss of feeling in the fingers A loss of strength and coordination, especially the ability to use your thumb to pinch You could end up with permanent muscle damage and lose function in your hand. So, don't put off seeing a doctor. Medical conditions sometimes linked to carpal tunnel syndrome include: Obesity Hypothyroidism Rheumatoid Arthritis Diabetes Pregnancy Trauma Women are three times more likely than men to get the condition. That may be because in general they have a smaller carpal tunnel than men. When the condition is brought on by pregnancy, the symptoms usually clear up within a few months after delivery. Certain jobs that involve repeating the same motion with your arm over a long time may raise your chances of getting the condition. Those jobs include: Assembly line worker Sewer or knitter Baker Cashier Hair stylist Musician Your doctor may ask you to tap the palm side of your wrist or fully flex your wrist with your arms completely extended. Another test called EMG- NCV measures the function of the nerve across the carpal tunnel. Lifestyle changes. If your symptoms are due to repetitive motion, you can take more frequent breaks or do a bit less of the activity that's causing you pain. Certain stretching and strengthening exercises could help, too. Speak with your doctor. Immobilization. The doctor may have you use a splint to keep your wrist from moving and to lessen pressure on the nerves. You may wear one at night to help get rid of that numbness or tingling feeling. This can help you sleep better and give your median nerve a rest. Medication . Your doctor may give you anti-inflammatory drugs or steroid shots to reduce swelling. Surgery. If none of the above treatments work, an operation may be an option. Talk with your doctor about it. Keep your wrists straight. Use a splint or brace that helps keep your wrist in a neutral position.

It can feel good when you help ease some of it. That isn't always easy to do, so talk to a doctor about it first.

They may not want to be a burden, or they may feel that it's a sign of weakness to admit it. Encourage them that it's OK to let you know how they really feel, so you can help them take care of it. Or they may have trouble expressing it if they have dementia or have had a stroke. It's important to help treat pain, so your loved one can keep up with daily activities, stay as independent as possible, and feel better mentally and physically. Ask the person you're caring for if he is in pain. Many of the signs are obvious -- crying, moaning, clenched fists, âknittedâ eyebrows. A poor appetite may also be a clue. If the person can't tell you if they're in pain, you may need to have a doctor or therapist do an exam, including a check for bedsores. A warm shower or bath, hot water bottle, or warm cloth can help relax muscles and ease muscle spasms. A heating pad with an automatic off switch is better than a regular heating pad, which can burn skin if left on too long. Be careful with microwavable heating pads, as these can have hot spots that burn. Apply heat to the sore area for 20 to 30 minutes every 2 hours. Don't use heat on open wounds. Cold can numb pain and ease swelling. Try a cool cloth, cold pack, cold compression wrap, or ice massage. To make an ice pack, put crushed ice in a plastic bag and cover it with a towel. Don't put the bag of ice directly on your loved one's skin. Or you can use a bag of frozen peas. Ice as soon as possible after an injury. Do it for 15-20 minutes at a time, 4-8 times per day. Stop icing when the area feels numb. Slow, quiet breathing helps relax the body and mind and ease pain. You can show your loved one how to do this: Lie or sit with one hand on your belly and take a deep, slow breath. Imagine filling a balloon in your belly with air. Then breathe out, as if you're letting all the air out of the balloon. Think of breathing out stressful thoughts and breathing in relaxation. Aim for about six long, deep breaths a minute. If your loved one has lung problems, talk to his doctor about what breathing exercises would be good to try, or if other ways to relax would be better. This can be as simple as a foot, back, or hand rub. With your whole hand, the heel of your hand, or your fingertips, apply gentle pressure in slow, steady, circular movements. Warm oil or lotion may help. Massage in one area for 10 seconds first to see if it feels good. Notice if he prefers a light stroke or a firm one. It shouldn't cause pain. Ask your loved one's doctor what nonprescription pain medicines are OK to use, if needed. Acetaminophen is probably the safest for mild to moderate pain. Never use more than your doctor recommends, because it can cause liver damage and other side effects. And check to make sure the person is not taking other drugs that have acetaminophen as an ingredient. This is a common problem. There are also pain relievers that go directly on the skin, such as creams, gels, sprays, and patches. If your loved one has long-term (chronic) pain, he might need over-the-counter as well as prescription drugs, including daily, extended-release pain medications and a plan for pain flare-ups. Keep a list of all the medications (prescription or over-the-counter), supplements, and doses your loved one takes, and share that list with their doctor. This is important to do because some combinations of medicines can be harmful, particularly for elderly people. Their doctor can check on safety and make changes if needed.

Over time, your chances of a second bout go up. One study found that within 7 years, the odds of getting it again may be almost 5%. That's about the same as the odds of getting shingles the first time. You're more likely to get it again if: You had severe pain from shingles that lasted more than 30 days. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia ( PHN). You are a woman. You were age 50 or older when you had shingles the first time. Your immune system is weak from conditions like leukemia, lymphoma, or HIV, or you take medicines that suppress your immune system. The CDC suggests getting the shingles vaccine Shingrix ( RZV) if you're age 50 or older. It was approved in 2017 and has been found to be more than 90% effective in preventing shingles and the complications caused by the disease. Even if you've already had shingles, the CDC says the vaccine can help prevent a second round of it. Shingrix is preferred over an earlier vaccine, Zostavax. You should also get it if you previously had the Zostavax vaccine. Talk to your doctor about when to get the vaccine. If you've just gotten over shingles, he CDC recommends waiting at least until the shingles rash has disappeared. You should not get the Shingrix vaccine if you: Are pregnant or nursing You are allergic to the vaccine You tested negative for immunity to chickenpox (varicella zoster)- If so, you should ask about the chicken pox (varicella) vaccine Since the older vaccine, Zostavax, is a live virus, You should not get it if you are allergic to the vaccine, have a weakened immune system, or are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant in the next 4 weeks. Shingles is likely to return in a different part of your body. In general, the rash is most common on the torso or face. So if you've had it on the right side of your stomach, it might come back on the left side - or on your face, chest, neck, or back. A blistering rash in the shape of a band is the telltale sign of shingles. If your immune system is weak, the rash may come on several parts of your body. Other symptoms to look out for: Pain, itching, or tingling, which may start a few days before the rash appears Headache Fever Chills Upset stomach See your doctor at the first sign of shingles. Getting treated early can help it go away faster and may help you avoid related problems. For instance, shingles on the face can cause hearing or sight problems, including blindness. If you have a weak immune system and can't get the vaccine, early treatment is your best defense against shingles. Sometimes what seems to be shingles is really herpes simplex. Though it usually appears as \"cold sores\" around the mouth or genitals, this form of herpes can show up elsewhere. A different treatment is used to clear it up. Your doctor can do tests, such as a viral culture, to confirm whether you have shingles and to get you the right treatment. As with a first case of shingles, antiviral medicines can help ease a second case. These include: Acyclovir Valacyclovir Famciclovir To relieve itching, try: Oatmeal baths Wet compresses Calamine lotion If you get PHN pain, your doctor may suggest gabapentin (an anti-seizure medicine) or a rub-on cream or lotion. Antidepressants can also help pain. Steroids are sometimes used to treat shingles. Shingles treatments like antivirals work best when you start them right away. Call your doctor as soon as a rash appears -- or you have any symptom you think may be shingles. If you had it once, you know the symptoms.

But if you're diagnosed with cervical cancer, know it's very treatable when your doctor finds it early. It's also one of the most preventable cancers in women because of available screenings and vaccinations. While regular screenings are the most important thing you can do to detect precancerous cells, there are other things you also need to know to spot symptoms early. The most important step to find precancerous cervical cells is getting screened. Tests can pick up changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Pap tests look for abnormal cells in your cervix that are starting to turn into cancer. Your gynecologist will perform a Pap test during your routine pelvic exam. It's quick and painless. You lie on an exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to keep your vagina open. It also lets her see your cervix. Next, she'll use a small brush to swab some cells from your cervix. The cells are sent a lab where they're checked for signs of cancer. Most women ages 21 to 65 need to be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap test every 3 years. You can get an HPV test alone or with your Pap test, known as co-testing, every five years starting after age 30. Human papilloma virus is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the high-risk types of the virus cause almost all cervical cancers. If you test positive for HPV, that doesn't mean you'll get cervical cancer. If you're over age 30, doctors recommend you get both tests every 3-5 years. Most women in the early stages of cervical cancer don't have any symptoms. That's why Pap and HPV screening tests are so important. Symptoms don't usually start until the cancer spreads to other organs and tissues. If you do have symptoms, you might notice: Abnormal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or after menopause) Heavier than normal periods Pain during sex Unusual vaginal discharge that might contain blood These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other diseases or infections cause them, too. See your gynecologist if you notice any of them. If you have an abnormal Pap test and other symptoms of cervical cancer, your gynecologist will want find out more about your medical history and your family's. She'll likely run more tests to find out if you have cancer cells in your cervix, and check your lymph nodes to see if cancer has spread. Some of the tests your gynecologist might use to check for cancer cells include: Colposcopy. During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix. This liquid helps her see any abnormal cells. It might burn a little. Cervical biopsies. Your doctor might also remove a small piece of tissue during your colposcopy to check for cancer. This is known as a colposcopic biopsy. Other types of biopsies include: Endocervical curettage uses a thin instrument called a curette to scrape away cells Loop electro-surgical excision procedure ( LEEP) uses a thin wire heated by an electric current to remove cells Punch biopsy uses a tool called biopsy forceps to remove tissue Cone biopsy is another, more invasive, way for your doctor to take a tissue sample, so it's usually performed in a hospital. It can also treat some early-stage cervical cancers. Your doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix with either a LEEP, scalpel or laser. Cells taken from your cervix from any type of biopsy will be sent to a lab and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. You might have mild cramps and bleeding after these procedures. If your biopsy shows you have cervical cancer, the next step is to see if it has spread, and where. Your doctor might order one or more of these tests: Cystoscopy and proctoscopy. These tests both use a lighted tube to see if the cancer has spread into your bladder and rectum. CT scan. This powerful X-ray can show your doctor if your cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, liver, lungs, or other parts of your body. MRI. Your doctor might use an MRI to get very detailed images of inside your body. An MRI can find cancer that has spread to your pelvis, brain, or spinal cord. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will look to see if cancer has spread to your lungs. Positron emission tomography ( PET). Your doctor might order a PET scan if she thinks your cancer has spread but isn't sure where. It uses a type of radioactive sugar that cancer cells absorb. A special camera can spot the cells that have absorbed the sugar. After all of the tests results are back, your doctor will use them to determine if and how far your cancer has spread, which will show them what stage it is in. Staging classifies the cancer by how much is in your body and where it has spread when it's diagnosed. Knowing the stage can help your medical team plan the right treatment for you. Stages of cervical cancer are: Stage 0. Cancer is only on the surface of the cervix and have not grown into deeper tissues. Stage I. The cancer has grown into the cervix and may be growing into the body of the uterus. It may also have spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread distantly. Stage II. The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and uterus. It may have reached the upper part of the vagina. It may involve local lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage III. The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina or the walls of the pelvis. It may or may not involve the nearby lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage IV. This is the most advanced stage. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, like the bladder, rectum, lungs, liver, or distant lymph nodes.

Current guidelines recommend yearly screening with cesarean section. It has not been fully proven that the use of a cervical cancer screening program reduces the risk of cervical cancer overall or in women with low-risk HPV infection, but it is supported for women at a high risk of cervical cancer or those who choose to undergo a hysterectomy for cervical cancer.  Although there are no direct and consistent clinical studies to indicate that annual cervical screening reduces the risk of cancer of the cervix, there have been multiple reports of abnormal Pap test results associated with screening.\nTop of Page\n2. Is HPV infection different depending on the race of the patient?\nYes, there are two types of HPV: types 6 and 11, which can be found in both men and women. Both HPV strains can cause cervical cancer, and in general, most cancers of the cervix are caused by types 6 and 11. Both HPV strains are also prevalent in the human papillomavirus (HPV), an envelope protein on the outer surface of the cell that has been associated with many types of cancers and diseases.

But if you're diagnosed with cervical cancer, know it's very treatable when your doctor finds it early. It's also one of the most preventable cancers in women because of available screenings and vaccinations. While regular screenings are the most important thing you can do to detect precancerous cells, there are other things you also need to know to spot symptoms early. The most important step to find precancerous cervical cells is getting screened. Tests can pick up changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Pap tests look for abnormal cells in your cervix that are starting to turn into cancer. Your gynecologist will perform a Pap test during your routine pelvic exam. It's quick and painless. You lie on an exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to keep your vagina open. It also lets her see your cervix. Next, she'll use a small brush to swab some cells from your cervix. The cells are sent a lab where they're checked for signs of cancer. Most women ages 21 to 65 need to be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap test every 3 years. You can get an HPV test alone or with your Pap test, known as co-testing, every five years starting after age 30. Human papilloma virus is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the high-risk types of the virus cause almost all cervical cancers. If you test positive for HPV, that doesn't mean you'll get cervical cancer. If you're over age 30, doctors recommend you get both tests every 3-5 years. Most women in the early stages of cervical cancer don't have any symptoms. That's why Pap and HPV screening tests are so important. Symptoms don't usually start until the cancer spreads to other organs and tissues. If you do have symptoms, you might notice: Abnormal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or after menopause) Heavier than normal periods Pain during sex Unusual vaginal discharge that might contain blood These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other diseases or infections cause them, too. See your gynecologist if you notice any of them. If you have an abnormal Pap test and other symptoms of cervical cancer, your gynecologist will want find out more about your medical history and your family's. She'll likely run more tests to find out if you have cancer cells in your cervix, and check your lymph nodes to see if cancer has spread. Some of the tests your gynecologist might use to check for cancer cells include: Colposcopy. During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix. This liquid helps her see any abnormal cells. It might burn a little. Cervical biopsies. Your doctor might also remove a small piece of tissue during your colposcopy to check for cancer. This is known as a colposcopic biopsy. Other types of biopsies include: Endocervical curettage uses a thin instrument called a curette to scrape away cells Loop electro-surgical excision procedure ( LEEP) uses a thin wire heated by an electric current to remove cells Punch biopsy uses a tool called biopsy forceps to remove tissue Cone biopsy is another, more invasive, way for your doctor to take a tissue sample, so it's usually performed in a hospital. It can also treat some early-stage cervical cancers. Your doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix with either a LEEP, scalpel or laser. Cells taken from your cervix from any type of biopsy will be sent to a lab and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. You might have mild cramps and bleeding after these procedures. If your biopsy shows you have cervical cancer, the next step is to see if it has spread, and where. Your doctor might order one or more of these tests: Cystoscopy and proctoscopy. These tests both use a lighted tube to see if the cancer has spread into your bladder and rectum. CT scan. This powerful X-ray can show your doctor if your cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, liver, lungs, or other parts of your body. MRI. Your doctor might use an MRI to get very detailed images of inside your body. An MRI can find cancer that has spread to your pelvis, brain, or spinal cord. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will look to see if cancer has spread to your lungs. Positron emission tomography ( PET). Your doctor might order a PET scan if she thinks your cancer has spread but isn't sure where. It uses a type of radioactive sugar that cancer cells absorb. A special camera can spot the cells that have absorbed the sugar. After all of the tests results are back, your doctor will use them to determine if and how far your cancer has spread, which will show them what stage it is in. Staging classifies the cancer by how much is in your body and where it has spread when it's diagnosed. Knowing the stage can help your medical team plan the right treatment for you.

But if you're diagnosed with cervical cancer, know it's very treatable when your doctor finds it early. It's also one of the most preventable cancers in women because of available screenings and vaccinations. While regular screenings are the most important thing you can do to detect precancerous cells, there are other things you also need to know to spot symptoms early. The most important step to find precancerous cervical cells is getting screened. Tests can pick up changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Pap tests look for abnormal cells in your cervix that are starting to turn into cancer. Your gynecologist will perform a Pap test during your routine pelvic exam. It's quick and painless. You lie on an exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to keep your vagina open. It also lets her see your cervix. Next, she'll use a small brush to swab some cells from your cervix. The cells are sent a lab where they're checked for signs of cancer. Most women ages 21 to 65 need to be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap test every 3 years. You can get an HPV test alone or with your Pap test, known as co-testing, every five years starting after age 30. Human papilloma virus is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the high-risk types of the virus cause almost all cervical cancers. If you test positive for HPV, that doesn't mean you'll get cervical cancer. If you're over age 30, doctors recommend you get both tests every 3-5 years. Most women in the early stages of cervical cancer don't have any symptoms. That's why Pap and HPV screening tests are so important. Symptoms don't usually start until the cancer spreads to other organs and tissues. If you do have symptoms, you might notice: Abnormal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or after menopause) Heavier than normal periods Pain during sex Unusual vaginal discharge that might contain blood These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other diseases or infections cause them, too. See your gynecologist if you notice any of them. If you have an abnormal Pap test and other symptoms of cervical cancer, your gynecologist will want find out more about your medical history and your family's. She'll likely run more tests to find out if you have cancer cells in your cervix, and check your lymph nodes to see if cancer has spread. Some of the tests your gynecologist might use to check for cancer cells include: Colposcopy. During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix. This liquid helps her see any abnormal cells. It might burn a little. Cervical biopsies. Your doctor might also remove a small piece of tissue during your colposcopy to check for cancer. This is known as a colposcopic biopsy. Other types of biopsies include: Endocervical curettage uses a thin instrument called a curette to scrape away cells Loop electro-surgical excision procedure ( LEEP) uses a thin wire heated by an electric current to remove cells Punch biopsy uses a tool called biopsy forceps to remove tissue Cone biopsy is another, more invasive, way for your doctor to take a tissue sample, so it's usually performed in a hospital. It can also treat some early-stage cervical cancers. Your doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix with either a LEEP, scalpel or laser. Cells taken from your cervix from any type of biopsy will be sent to a lab and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. You might have mild cramps and bleeding after these procedures. If your biopsy shows you have cervical cancer, the next step is to see if it has spread, and where. Your doctor might order one or more of these tests: Cystoscopy and proctoscopy.

The cells are sent a lab where they're checked for signs of cancer. Most women ages 21 to 65 need to be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap test every 3 years. You can get an HPV test alone or with your Pap test, known as co-testing, every five years starting after age 30. Human papilloma virus is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the high-risk types of the virus cause almost all cervical cancers. If you test positive for HPV, that doesn't mean you'll get cervical cancer. If you're over age 30, doctors recommend you get both tests every 3-5 years. Most women in the early stages of cervical cancer don't have any symptoms. That's why Pap and HPV screening tests are so important. Symptoms don't usually start until the cancer spreads to other organs and tissues. If you do have symptoms, you might notice: Abnormal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or after menopause) Heavier than normal periods Pain during sex Unusual vaginal discharge that might contain blood These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other diseases or infections cause them, too. See your gynecologist if you notice any of them. If you have an abnormal Pap test and other symptoms of cervical cancer, your gynecologist will want find out more about your medical history and your family's. She'll likely run more tests to find out if you have cancer cells in your cervix, and check your lymph nodes to see if cancer has spread. Some of the tests your gynecologist might use to check for cancer cells include: Colposcopy. During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix. This liquid helps her see any abnormal cells. It might burn a little. Cervical biopsies. Your doctor might also remove a small piece of tissue during your colposcopy to check for cancer. This is known as a colposcopic biopsy. Other types of biopsies include: Endocervical curettage uses a thin instrument called a curette to scrape away cells Loop electro-surgical excision procedure ( LEEP) uses a thin wire heated by an electric current to remove cells Punch biopsy uses a tool called biopsy forceps to remove tissue Cone biopsy is another, more invasive, way for your doctor to take a tissue sample, so it's usually performed in a hospital. It can also treat some early-stage cervical cancers. Your doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix with either a LEEP, scalpel or laser. Cells taken from your cervix from any type of biopsy will be sent to a lab and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. You might have mild cramps and bleeding after these procedures. If your biopsy shows you have cervical cancer, the next step is to see if it has spread, and where. Your doctor might order one or more of these tests: Cystoscopy and proctoscopy. These tests both use a lighted tube to see if the cancer has spread into your bladder and rectum. CT scan. This powerful X-ray can show your doctor if your cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, liver, lungs, or other parts of your body. MRI. Your doctor might use an MRI to get very detailed images of inside your body. An MRI can find cancer that has spread to your pelvis, brain, or spinal cord. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will look to see if cancer has spread to your lungs. Positron emission tomography ( PET). Your doctor might order a PET scan if she thinks your cancer has spread but isn't sure where. It uses a type of radioactive sugar that cancer cells absorb. A special camera can spot the cells that have absorbed the sugar. After all of the tests results are back, your doctor will use them to determine if and how far your cancer has spread, which will show them what stage it is in. Staging classifies the cancer by how much is in your body and where it has spread when it's diagnosed. Knowing the stage can help your medical team plan the right treatment for you. Stages of cervical cancer are: Stage 0. Cancer is only on the surface of the cervix and have not grown into deeper tissues. Stage I. The cancer has grown into the cervix and may be growing into the body of the uterus. It may also have spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread distantly. Stage II. The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and uterus. It may have reached the upper part of the vagina. It may involve local lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage III. The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina or the walls of the pelvis. It may or may not involve the nearby lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage IV. This is the most advanced stage. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, like the bladder, rectum, lungs, liver, or distant lymph nodes. Your stage of a cancer won't be changed if your cancer gets worse or comes back.

The cancer has grown into the cervix and may be growing into the body of the uterus. It may also have spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not spread distantly. Stage II. The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and uterus. It may have reached the upper part of the vagina. It may involve local lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage III. The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina or the walls of the pelvis. It may or may not involve the nearby lymph nodes but has not spread to distant sites. Stage IV. This is the most advanced stage. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, like the bladder, rectum, lungs, liver, or distant lymph nodes.

But if you're diagnosed with cervical cancer, know it's very treatable when your doctor finds it early. It's also one of the most preventable cancers in women because of available screenings and vaccinations. While regular screenings are the most important thing you can do to detect precancerous cells, there are other things you also need to know to spot symptoms early. The most important step to find precancerous cervical cells is getting screened. Tests can pick up changes in cervical cells before they become cancer. Pap tests look for abnormal cells in your cervix that are starting to turn into cancer. Your gynecologist will perform a Pap test during your routine pelvic exam. It's quick and painless. You lie on an exam table and your doctor will use a speculum to keep your vagina open. It also lets her see your cervix. Next, she'll use a small brush to swab some cells from your cervix. The cells are sent a lab where they're checked for signs of cancer. Most women ages 21 to 65 need to be screened for cervical cancer with a Pap test every 3 years. You can get an HPV test alone or with your Pap test, known as co-testing, every five years starting after age 30. Human papilloma virus is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the high-risk types of the virus cause almost all cervical cancers. If you test positive for HPV, that doesn't mean you'll get cervical cancer. If you're over age 30, doctors recommend you get both tests every 3-5 years. Most women in the early stages of cervical cancer don't have any symptoms. That's why Pap and HPV screening tests are so important. Symptoms don't usually start until the cancer spreads to other organs and tissues. If you do have symptoms, you might notice: Abnormal bleeding (between periods, after sex, or after menopause) Heavier than normal periods Pain during sex Unusual vaginal discharge that might contain blood These symptoms do not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other diseases or infections cause them, too. See your gynecologist if you notice any of them. If you have an abnormal Pap test and other symptoms of cervical cancer, your gynecologist will want find out more about your medical history and your family's. She'll likely run more tests to find out if you have cancer cells in your cervix, and check your lymph nodes to see if cancer has spread. Some of the tests your gynecologist might use to check for cancer cells include: Colposcopy. During this test, your doctor will use an instrument called a colposcope, which looks a lot like a microscope, to get an up close look at your cervix. You'll lie on an exam table and she'll use a speculum to keep your vagina open. Next she'll rub a solution of acetic acid (similar to vinegar) on your cervix. This liquid helps her see any abnormal cells. It might burn a little. Cervical biopsies. Your doctor might also remove a small piece of tissue during your colposcopy to check for cancer. This is known as a colposcopic biopsy. Other types of biopsies include: Endocervical curettage uses a thin instrument called a curette to scrape away cells Loop electro-surgical excision procedure ( LEEP) uses a thin wire heated by an electric current to remove cells Punch biopsy uses a tool called biopsy forceps to remove tissue Cone biopsy is another, more invasive, way for your doctor to take a tissue sample, so it's usually performed in a hospital. It can also treat some early-stage cervical cancers. Your doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of tissue from your cervix with either a LEEP, scalpel or laser. Cells taken from your cervix from any type of biopsy will be sent to a lab and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. You might have mild cramps and bleeding after these procedures. If your biopsy shows you have cervical cancer, the next step is to see if it has spread, and where. Your doctor might order one or more of these tests: Cystoscopy and proctoscopy. These tests both use a lighted tube to see if the cancer has spread into your bladder and rectum. CT scan. This powerful X-ray can show your doctor if your cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, liver, lungs, or other parts of your body. MRI. Your doctor might use an MRI to get very detailed images of inside your body. An MRI can find cancer that has spread to your pelvis, brain, or spinal cord. Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray will look to see if cancer has spread to your lungs. Positron emission tomography ( PET). Your doctor might order a PET scan if she thinks your cancer has spread but isn't sure where. It uses a type of radioactive sugar that cancer cells absorb. A special camera can spot the cells that have absorbed the sugar. After all of the tests results are back, your doctor will use them to determine if and how far your cancer has spread, which will show them what stage it is in.

Psoriasis flares here can be more embarrassing, painful, and harder to treat. Some common ways to deal with psoriasis -- like managing your stress, not smoking, putting on moisturizer after a shower or bath, and getting plenty of rest -- are good for these areas, too. But others are too harsh for tender skin. You'll need to consider where your patches are when you make decisions about what to do. Keep these things in mind to protect your sensitive skin and make living with your psoriasis easier. Work closely with your doctor to find a way to control your symptoms. Let him know if anything you put on your skin burns or stings, or if you get an infection. Low-dose steroid cream. Doctors often prescribe it first because it's one of the best treatments. When you have an infection, the medicine to treat it might be mixed with a steroid. But you have to use steroids with care. Thin skin absorbs medicine more easily, so you're more likely to have side effects. A steroid cream can also make your skin even thinner and cause stretch marks or broken blood vessels if you use it too long. Your doctor will likely prescribe a low-dose steroid cream for a short time. Mild vitamin D creams. These have fewer long-term side effects than steroids, and you can use them longer. Sometimes they're mixed with a mild steroid to make them less irritating. Only use the one your doctor prescribes, since not all vitamin D creams work well for sensitive skin. Light treatments (phototherapy). UVB rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells and help many kinds of psoriasis. Artificial UVB light works on most parts of the body, but not your genitals. Moisturize. This is a key part of daily care for psoriasis on your whole body, including sensitive areas. A lighter texture is better for delicate skin. Go fragrance- and alcohol-free. Ceramides, lipids, and hyaluronic acid will help replace the natural moisturizers in your skin. Some people swear by oils like olive, coconut, and jojoba, too. Go soapless. Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry. Peeling creams. The best products to soften and remove scales have salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, or phenol. Some over-the counter ( OTC) peels may be too strong, so check with your doctor before you use them. Avoid peels on cracked or bleeding skin. Use an OTC antibiotic that you put on the area to help heal it. A light foundation makeup is often all you need. Even when you're trying to cover severe psoriasis, choose a formula specifically meant for your face. Pick something that's not too slippery, so it sticks to your skin, but not so dry that it makes flakes worse. Match your normal skin tone; don't go darker or lighter. You may have better luck finding items at a beauty products store. It might be worth it to have a makeup artist give you some tips about what things to use and how to apply them. For example, many professionals recommend using a primer after your moisturizer and before your foundation to help even out your skin. Since your hair can touch your face and neck, your styling products could be causing irritation. Look for fragrance- and alcohol-free ones. Products with fewer ingredients, that are natural rather than chemical, are safer. Wear loose-fitting clothes and underwear, like boxers or boy shorts. Tight clothes rub on sensitive skin and can make symptoms flare. Choose natural fabrics. Clothes made from cotton or silk are kinder to your skin than synthetics. Avoid scratchy wool. Change your clothes right after exercise so sweat doesn't stay close to your skin and irritate it. Although it may sound like a good idea, workout gear made of \"moisture-wicking\" fabrics might stick to affected skin. Sometimes, especially to the untrained eye, genital psoriasis can look like an STD. Assure your partner that your skin rash isn't contagious. Use non-latex condoms to avoid problems with psoriasis treatments that make latex condoms less effective. You can find them in most supermarkets and pharmacies. Lubricants can make sex more enjoyable for both men and women. Clean your genital area afterward, and apply more medication if you need to. Let your partner know when it's not comfortable to have sex, but don't shut them out. Tell them where you do want to be touched and what feels good to you.

Psoriasis flares here can be more embarrassing, painful, and harder to treat. Some common ways to deal with psoriasis -- like managing your stress, not smoking, putting on moisturizer after a shower or bath, and getting plenty of rest -- are good for these areas, too. But others are too harsh for tender skin. You'll need to consider where your patches are when you make decisions about what to do. Keep these things in mind to protect your sensitive skin and make living with your psoriasis easier. Work closely with your doctor to find a way to control your symptoms. Let him know if anything you put on your skin burns or stings, or if you get an infection. Low-dose steroid cream. Doctors often prescribe it first because it's one of the best treatments. When you have an infection, the medicine to treat it might be mixed with a steroid. But you have to use steroids with care. Thin skin absorbs medicine more easily, so you're more likely to have side effects. A steroid cream can also make your skin even thinner and cause stretch marks or broken blood vessels if you use it too long. Your doctor will likely prescribe a low-dose steroid cream for a short time. Mild vitamin D creams. These have fewer long-term side effects than steroids, and you can use them longer. Sometimes they're mixed with a mild steroid to make them less irritating. Only use the one your doctor prescribes, since not all vitamin D creams work well for sensitive skin. Light treatments (phototherapy). UVB rays in sunlight slow the growth of skin cells and help many kinds of psoriasis. Artificial UVB light works on most parts of the body, but not your genitals. Moisturize. This is a key part of daily care for psoriasis on your whole body, including sensitive areas. A lighter texture is better for delicate skin. Go fragrance- and alcohol-free. Ceramides, lipids, and hyaluronic acid will help replace the natural moisturizers in your skin. Some people swear by oils like olive, coconut, and jojoba, too. Go soapless. Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry. Peeling creams. The best products to soften and remove scales have salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, or phenol. Some over-the counter ( OTC) peels may be too strong, so check with your doctor before you use them. Avoid peels on cracked or bleeding skin. Use an OTC antibiotic that you put on the area to help heal it. A light foundation makeup is often all you need. Even when you're trying to cover severe psoriasis, choose a formula specifically meant for your face. Pick something that's not too slippery, so it sticks to your skin, but not so dry that it makes flakes worse. Match your normal skin tone; don't go darker or lighter. You may have better luck finding items at a beauty products store. It might be worth it to have a makeup artist give you some tips about what things to use and how to apply them. For example, many professionals recommend using a primer after your moisturizer and before your foundation to help even out your skin. Since your hair can touch your face and neck, your styling products could be causing irritation. Look for fragrance- and alcohol-free ones. Products with fewer ingredients, that are natural rather than chemical, are safer. Wear loose-fitting clothes and underwear, like boxers or boy shorts. Tight clothes rub on sensitive skin and can make symptoms flare. Choose natural fabrics. Clothes made from cotton or silk are kinder to your skin than synthetics. Avoid scratchy wool. Change your clothes right after exercise so sweat doesn't stay close to your skin and irritate it. Although it may sound like a good idea, workout gear made of \"moisture-wicking\" fabrics might stick to affected skin. Sometimes, especially to the untrained eye, genital psoriasis can look like an STD. Assure your partner that your skin rash isn't contagious. Use non-latex condoms to avoid problems with psoriasis treatments that make latex condoms less effective. You can find them in most supermarkets and pharmacies. Lubricants can make sex more enjoyable for both men and women. Clean your genital area afterward, and apply more medication if you need to. Let your partner know when it's not comfortable to have sex, but don't shut them out. Tell them where you do want to be touched and what feels good to you.

Use natural cleansing milks, oils, or balms to wash your face and body instead of soap. If you do use soap, choose one without deodorant. Baby your skin. Creases and folds in your skin can get warm and damp, making them more prone to infection. Dust baby powder or baking soda under your breasts and in your groin to help skin stay cool and dry. Peeling creams. The best products to soften and remove scales have salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, or phenol. Some over-the counter ( OTC) peels may be too strong, so check with your doctor before you use them. Avoid peels on cracked or bleeding skin. Use an OTC antibiotic that you put on the area to help heal it. A light foundation makeup is often all you need. Even when you're trying to cover severe psoriasis, choose a formula specifically meant for your face. Pick something that's not too slippery, so it sticks to your skin, but not so dry that it makes flakes worse. Match your normal skin tone; don't go darker or lighter. You may have better luck finding items at a beauty products store. It might be worth it to have a makeup artist give you some tips about what things to use and how to apply them. For example, many professionals recommend using a primer after your moisturizer and before your foundation to help even out your skin. Since your hair can touch your face and neck, your styling products could be causing irritation. Look for fragrance- and alcohol-free ones. Products with fewer ingredients, that are natural rather than chemical, are safer. Wear loose-fitting clothes and underwear, like boxers or boy shorts. Tight clothes rub on sensitive skin and can make symptoms flare. Choose natural fabrics. Clothes made from cotton or silk are kinder to your skin than synthetics. Avoid scratchy wool. Change your clothes right after exercise so sweat doesn't stay close to your skin and irritate it. Although it may sound like a good idea, workout gear made of \"moisture-wicking\" fabrics might stick to affected skin. Sometimes, especially to the untrained eye, genital psoriasis can look like an STD. Assure your partner that your skin rash isn't contagious. Use non-latex condoms to avoid problems with psoriasis treatments that make latex condoms less effective. You can find them in most supermarkets and pharmacies. Lubricants can make sex more enjoyable for both men and women. Clean your genital area afterward, and apply more medication if you need to. Let your partner know when it's not comfortable to have sex, but don't shut them out. Tell them where you do want to be touched and what feels good to you. Extra pounds can create more skin folds where psoriasis could show up. When you're heavy, you're also more likely to sweat, which can make your symptoms worse. Losing a few pounds may make a big difference to your comfort and the health of your skin.", "question": "How much makeup can I use to cover severe psoriasis?", "answer": ["A light foundation makeup is often all you need.

But do you know what the cholesterol test results actually mean? Read on to learn how to interpret the numbers. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance. Your liver makes all the cholesterol your body needs. But you take in more cholesterol from certain foods, such as those from animals. If you have too much cholesterol in your body, it can build up in the walls of your arteries (as \"plaque\") and eventually harden. This process, called atherosclerosis, actually narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to travel through the vessels. Unfortunately, high cholesterol doesn't cause symptoms. In later stages of atherosclerosis, though, you may suffer angina -- severe chest pain from lack of blood flow to the heart. If an artery gets totally blocked, a heart attack results. A routine blood cholesterol test is a far better way of finding out what your cholesterol level is. In addition to measuring the total cholesterol in your blood, the standard cholesterol test (called a \"lipid panel\") measures three specific kinds of fat: Low-density lipoproteins ( LDL). This is the \"bad cholesterol,\" the main cause of plaque build-up, which increases your risk for heart disease. In general, the lower the number, the better. But LDL cholesterol is only one part of a larger equation that measures a person's overall risk of having a heart attack or stroke. For years, guidelines focused on specific target numbers for individuals to achieve to lower their risk. The most recent guidelines focus on a person's overall risk and, based on that risk, recommend a certain percentage of LDL reduction as one part of a strategy for preventing serious heart and vascular problems. High-density lipoproteins ( HDL). This is the \"good cholesterol.\" It transports bad cholesterol from the blood to the liver, where it is excreted by the body. Your HDL is another part of the equation that identifies the risk of a cardiovascular event. In general, the higher the number the better, although, as with LDL, the emphasis has shifted from specific target numbers to strategies for reducing the overall risk. Triglycerides. Another type of fat in the bloodstream, triglycerides are also linked to heart disease. They are stored in fat cells throughout the body. If you have a lipoprotein profile, it's important to look at all the numbers from the cholesterol test, not just the total cholesterol number. That's because LDL and HDL levels are two primary indicators of potential heart disease. Use the information below to interpret your results (with the help of your doctor, of course). This will help you get a better idea about your risk for heart disease. Total blood cholesterol level: High risk: 240 mg/d L and above Borderline high risk: 200-239 mg/d L Desirable: Less than 200 mg/d L LDL cholesterol levels: 190 mg/d L and above represents a high risk for heart disease and is a strong indicator that the individual can benefit from intensive treatment, including life style changes, diet, and statin therapy for reducing that risk. For LDL levels that are equal to or less than 189 mg/d L, the guidelines recommend strategies for lowering LDL by 30% to 50% depending on what other risk factors you have that can affect the health of your heart and blood vessels. HDL cholesterol: High risk: Less than 40 mg/d L for men and less than 50 mg/d L for women Triglycerides: Very high risk: 500 mg/d L and above High risk: 200-499 mg/d L Borderline high risk: 150-199 mg/d L Normal: Less than 150 mg/d L If your doctor recommends a \"non-fasting\" cholesterol test, the lab will look only at your total cholesterol (and sometimes your HDL) numbers. For that test, you merely need to show up at the lab and have some blood drawn. If your doctor suggests a \"fasting\" cholesterol test (also called a \"lipid profile\"), the lab will analyze your levels of LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. For that test, you will need to fast nine to 12 hours before the blood test. Sometimes a doctor will ask you to do a non-fasting cholesterol test first. Depending on the results, he or she may then send you back for the more complete lipid profile. After reviewing your blood test, The doctor will also consider other risk factors you might have for heart disease, including: Your family history Age Weight Race Gender Diet Blood pressure and whether or not you're being treated for high blood pressure Activity level Smoking status History of diabetes Evidence of elevated blood sugars Then, your doctor will talk with you about your level of risk and the potential benefit to be derived by taking steps that include changes in your level of activity and diet as well as using medication to improve your cholesterol levels in order to reduce your overall risk.

But do you know what the cholesterol test results actually mean? Read on to learn how to interpret the numbers. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance. Your liver makes all the cholesterol your body needs. But you take in more cholesterol from certain foods, such as those from animals. If you have too much cholesterol in your body, it can build up in the walls of your arteries (as \"plaque\") and eventually harden. This process, called atherosclerosis, actually narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to travel through the vessels. Unfortunately, high cholesterol doesn't cause symptoms. In later stages of atherosclerosis, though, you may suffer angina -- severe chest pain from lack of blood flow to the heart. If an artery gets totally blocked, a heart attack results. A routine blood cholesterol test is a far better way of finding out what your cholesterol level is. In addition to measuring the total cholesterol in your blood, the standard cholesterol test (called a \"lipid panel\") measures three specific kinds of fat: Low-density lipoproteins ( LDL). This is the \"bad cholesterol,\" the main cause of plaque build-up, which increases your risk for heart disease. In general, the lower the number, the better. But LDL cholesterol is only one part of a larger equation that measures a person's overall risk of having a heart attack or stroke. For years, guidelines focused on specific target numbers for individuals to achieve to lower their risk. The most recent guidelines focus on a person's overall risk and, based on that risk, recommend a certain percentage of LDL reduction as one part of a strategy for preventing serious heart and vascular problems. High-density lipoproteins ( HDL). This is the \"good cholesterol.\" It transports bad cholesterol from the blood to the liver, where it is excreted by the body. Your HDL is another part of the equation that identifies the risk of a cardiovascular event. In general, the higher the number the better, although, as with LDL, the emphasis has shifted from specific target numbers to strategies for reducing the overall risk. Triglycerides. Another type of fat in the bloodstream, triglycerides are also linked to heart disease. They are stored in fat cells throughout the body. If you have a lipoprotein profile, it's important to look at all the numbers from the cholesterol test, not just the total cholesterol number. That's because LDL and HDL levels are two primary indicators of potential heart disease. Use the information below to interpret your results (with the help of your doctor, of course). This will help you get a better idea about your risk for heart disease. Total blood cholesterol level: High risk: 240 mg/d L and above Borderline high risk: 200-239 mg/d L Desirable: Less than 200 mg/d L LDL cholesterol levels: 190 mg/d L and above represents a high risk for heart disease and is a strong indicator that the individual can benefit from intensive treatment, including life style changes, diet, and statin therapy for reducing that risk. For LDL levels that are equal to or less than 189 mg/d L, the guidelines recommend strategies for lowering LDL by 30% to 50% depending on what other risk factors you have that can affect the health of your heart and blood vessels. HDL cholesterol: High risk: Less than 40 mg/d L for men and less than 50 mg/d L for women Triglycerides: Very high risk: 500 mg/d L and above High risk: 200-499 mg/d L Borderline high risk: 150-199 mg/d L Normal: Less than 150 mg/d L If your doctor recommends a \"non-fasting\" cholesterol test, the lab will look only at your total cholesterol (and sometimes your HDL) numbers. For that test, you merely need to show up at the lab and have some blood drawn. If your doctor suggests a \"fasting\" cholesterol test (also called a \"lipid profile\"), the lab will analyze your levels of LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. For that test, you will need to fast nine to 12 hours before the blood test. Sometimes a doctor will ask you to do a non-fasting cholesterol test first. Depending on the results, he or she may then send you back for the more complete lipid profile. After reviewing your blood test, The doctor will also consider other risk factors you might have for heart disease, including: Your family history Age Weight Race Gender Diet Blood pressure and whether or not you're being treated for high blood pressure Activity level Smoking status History of diabetes Evidence of elevated blood sugars Then, your doctor will talk with you about your level of risk and the potential benefit to be derived by taking steps that include changes in your level of activity and diet as well as using medication to improve your cholesterol levels in order to reduce your overall risk.

But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional. Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication. Problems sleeping: The most common type of medication used to treat ADHD is stimulant drugs. These medications increase the levels of chemicals in the brain called dopamine and norepinephrine. That may cause your child to have problems falling asleep, especially when she first starts taking them. In many cases, the sleep problems can be fixed by changing what time the child takes the medication, or switching from a long-acting formula to one that wears off a few hours before bedtime. Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day. Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help. Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food. Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight. Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain. Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression.

Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help. Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food. Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight. Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain. Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression. Bupropion has many of the same potential side effects as stimulants, including irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, and a worsening of existing tics. At high doses, it may make some people more likely to have seizures and can cause hallucinations.", "question": "Can ADHD medicine lead to suicidal thoughts?", "answer": ["Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression.

But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional. Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication. Problems sleeping: The most common type of medication used to treat ADHD is stimulant drugs. These medications increase the levels of chemicals in the brain called dopamine and norepinephrine. That may cause your child to have problems falling asleep, especially when she first starts taking them. In many cases, the sleep problems can be fixed by changing what time the child takes the medication, or switching from a long-acting formula to one that wears off a few hours before bedtime. Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day. Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help. Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food. Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight. Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain. Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression. Bupropion has many of the same potential side effects as stimulants, including irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, and a worsening of existing tics.

But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional. Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication. Problems sleeping: The most common type of medication used to treat ADHD is stimulant drugs. These medications increase the levels of chemicals in the brain called dopamine and norepinephrine. That may cause your child to have problems falling asleep, especially when she first starts taking them. In many cases, the sleep problems can be fixed by changing what time the child takes the medication, or switching from a long-acting formula to one that wears off a few hours before bedtime. Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day. Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help. Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food. Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight. Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse.

Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain. Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression. Bupropion has many of the same potential side effects as stimulants, including irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, and a worsening of existing tics.

But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional.

But these meds can cause a range of side effects, both physical and emotional. Before your child starts taking an ADHD medication for the first time, or switches to a different drug or a new dose, note her habits before she starts the drug so you can tell if a new behavior may be a side effect. It's common to have some early side effects. It can take a few days or a few weeks for her body to adjust. If any changes concern you, talk to your child's doctor to decide whether you should stay the course, switch to another medication, adjust the dosage, or stop medication. Problems sleeping: The most common type of medication used to treat ADHD is stimulant drugs. These medications increase the levels of chemicals in the brain called dopamine and norepinephrine. That may cause your child to have problems falling asleep, especially when she first starts taking them. In many cases, the sleep problems can be fixed by changing what time the child takes the medication, or switching from a long-acting formula to one that wears off a few hours before bedtime. Some children take nonstimulant medications such as guanfacine ( Intuniv, Tenex) and clonidine ( Kapvay). These medicines can have the reverse effect and make your child feel sleepy during the day. Taking the dose closer to bedtime or breaking it into two doses can help. Aches and nausea: Your child may have minor headaches, tummy aches, or even feel sick to his stomach when she starts a new medication. These side effects usually go away after a few days or weeks. It may help if she takes her medication with food. Less appetite: If your child takes a stimulant medicine, it's common for her to have little or no desire to eat the first few hours afterward. This may change after a few weeks. If it doesn't, you might try giving her the medicine after a healthy breakfast. Then she can eat a small lunch and have a larger meal later in the day when the drug's effect wears off. Talk with her doctor if your child is losing weight. Irritability or moodiness : The effects of ADHD medications last only for as long as the drug is in your child's system. Depending on the formula, that can be anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. When the drug wears off, your child can have a marked âreboundâ period, when she's cranky, often around dinnertime or bedtime. It can make a big difference if you plan activities around these times. For example, wait until after dinner to start homework, or have a soothing bath and read at bedtime. Your doctor may also recommend a small dose of a shorter-acting medication later in the day. This is sometimes called a booster dose or a homework pill. Fainting and dizziness : In addition to drowsiness and irritability, the nonstimulants clonidine and guanfacine may cause a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and that can lead to fainting and dizziness. A rapid rise in blood pressure can happen if the medications is stopped suddenly, so don't stop the medicine without talking to her doctor. Changes in growth: There's been some concern over the effects of stimulants on children's growth, both in height and weight, because of the initial decrease in appetite and an increase in dopamine, which can slow down growth hormones. But the effect, if any, appears to be temporary. A 2014 study from Boston Children's Hospital found that children with ADHD who took stimulants had no significant changes in growth and, as adults, were no shorter on average than adults who didn't take stimulants. Though serious side effects are rare, they can happen. If you notice anything that worries you, call the doctor right away. Don't give your child another dose until you talk to the doctor. Hallucinations: Children who take stimulants for ADHD have a slight chance of hearing voices, seeing imaginary things such as insects, and having feelings of paranoia. Report any unusual behavior such as this to your doctor. Suicidal thoughts: Some children who have ADHD may also suffer from depression. Those who are taking the nonstimulant atomoxetine ( Strattera) may have a slight risk of feeling suicidal. If you suspect your child is having any thoughts like this, contact your doctor immediately. Personality changes: When a stimulant dose is too high, some children may zone out, or behave in a âzombie-likeâ manner. If your child seems tearful, withdrawn, or overly sedated, discuss a change in medication with your doctor. Tics: Children who take stimulant medicines sometimes develop tics such as involuntary blinking, facial movements, or constant throat clearing. But because there is a link between Tourette's syndrome and ADHD (about 60% of children with Tourette's also have ADHD), it's unclear if the medications cause the tics or just make them worse. If a change causes social problems, talk to your child's doctor about switching to a nonstimulant. Heart problems: Though stimulants have been found to be safe in healthy children, they can cause a heart attack or stroke in people who are at risk for heart disease. Discuss any heart conditions, heart birth defects, symptoms (such as fainting or irregular heartbeat), or a family history of heart disease with the doctor before your child takes any new medication. Liver damage: In extremely rare cases, Strattera may cause jaundice or liver damage. Notify your child's doctor immediately if your child's skin is turning yellow or she has dark urine, flu-like symptoms, or upper belly pain. Antidepressants haven't been approved for treating ADHD, but some, including bupropion ( Wellbutrin), may be prescribed for children who haven't responded well to other ADHD treatments, or who also suffer from a mood disorder such as anxiety or depression. Bupropion has many of the same potential side effects as stimulants, including irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, and a worsening of existing tics. At high doses, it may make some people more likely to have seizures and can cause hallucinations.", "question": "Does bupropion have different side effects from stimulants?", "answer": ["Bupropion has many of the same potential side effects as stimulants, including irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, and a worsening of existing tics.

This type of doctor treats eye diseases. If you catch it early, there's a chance you can stop long-term damage. High blood sugar weakens the blood vessels in your eyes. That can make them leak or grow out of control in your retina, the light-sensitive area at the back of your eye. This is called diabetic retinopathy. When fluid seeps into your retina, it can cause diabetic macular edema. The leaking makes your retina swell, which hampers the work of your macula, the special, sensitive part that gives you sharp vision. Diabetic macular edema doesn't always cause symptoms. But you may: Have images directly in front of you appear blurry or wavy See colors that seem âwashed outâ If this happens to you, see your doctor right away. Before any testing, your doctor may ask you questions: Have you noticed changes in your vision? If so, what kind? Have you been diagnosed with diabetes? If so, when? Does anyone in your family have it? How have your blood sugar and A1c levels been lately? Do you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Do you have any other medical conditions? You will need a thorough eye exam, which usually includes: A visual acuity test. It checks how well you see at different distances. A dilated eye exam. Your doctor will use drops to widen your pupils and look at the inside of your eyes. He'll look for signs of disease, including damaged or leaking blood vessels, swelling, and fatty deposits on the retina. If your doctor thinks you have diabetic macular edema, you may also need one or both of these tests: A fluorescein angiogram ( FA) takes pictures of your retina using a special dye that helps find any leaking blood vessels. The dye is injected into your arm, but travels quickly to your eye. Optical coherence tomography ( OCT) uses a special camera to photograph your retina. It is very sensitive and can find even small amounts of fluid and swelling. What is causing my symptoms? Will I lose my sight? Am I at risk for other eye diseases? Do you have experience treating diabetic macular edema? What type of treatment do you recommend for me? What can I expect from it? What else can I do to protect my vision? How often will I need to have my eyes checked? To treat diabetic macular edema, doctors may use drugs that are injected into your eyes to help stop leaking, and to slow the growth of new blood vessels. These drugs include: Avastin (bevacizumab) Eylea (aflibercept) Iluvien (fluocinolone acetonide) Lucentis (ranibizumab) Macugen (pegaptanib) In severe cases, you may also have laser photocoagulation. A doctor will use a tiny laser on your eye to seal leaking blood vessels. You may need more than one treatment to control the problem. It's usually not painful, but you may have slight stinging feeling when the laser touches you. Sometimes steroid injections may help. Another treatment is a surgery called vitrectomy. This is usually done because of bleeding (not macular edema), and doctors take out the fluid that is clouding your vision and replace it with a clear solution. There's a lot you can do to prevent your condition from getting worse. First, manage your diabetes by controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol.

Treatment can include surgery.\n\nWhich medical conditions cause diabetes?\n\nDiabetes is a disorder of metabolism. The body produces enough glucose to support the body's needs. When excess sugar is not consumed from the diet, it's converted into fat in the liver, which can then get stored. This fat, in turn, makes glucose for the body to use. This excess sugar can cause a dangerous and potentially fatal condition called type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is caused by the buildup of fat in the pancreas. The person with diabetes usually has an insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia. While no medical test can diagnose this condition, it can be treated with medications.

You feel like you might have diarrhea. Does this sound like you? Or, you had milk, mashed potatoes, or even candy almost 2 hours ago and have these symptoms. Does that sound like you? If either does, you could have lactose intolerance. Lactose is the main sugar in milk and most other dairy products. Your small intestine makes the enzyme lactase to help you digest that sugar. When you're lactose intolerant, you don't make enough lactase to digest lactose well. You can't cure lactose intolerance, but if you change what and how you eat, you may get rid of your symptoms. Millions of Americans have symptoms of lactose intolerance: Bloating Cramps Diarrhea Painful gas Nausea You can use trial and error to find out what foods cause symptoms, and in what amount. And then check in with your doctor for a diagnosis. You may be sensitive to small amounts of foods that have lactose, or you may only have symptoms if you eat a lot of lactose foods. Your symptoms may be severe or mild. Lactose intolerance is different for everyone. Milk and dairy products are the best-known lactose foods, but there are many others. Some nondairy products have a protein called casein, which can have traces of lactose. To avoid symptoms from lactose intolerance, read food labels carefully. When shopping or cooking, look for these ingredients that have lactose: Curds Dry milk solids Milk Milk byproducts Dry milk powder Whey If you are highly sensitive to lactose, you may need to avoid foods such as: Baked goods Bread, baking, and pancake mixes Breakfast cereals Certain types of candy, such as milk chocolate Instant foods (breakfast drink mixes, mashed potatoes, soups, and meal replacement drinks) Margarine Nondairy creamers (liquid and powdered) Nondairy whipped topping Processed meats (bacon, hot dogs, sausage, and lunch meats) Protein and meal replacement bars Salad dressing Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of the foods you eat, to note when you have symptoms, and to stop eating an offending food to see if your symptoms go away. To help make a diagnosis, some doctors simply look at your symptoms and whether avoiding dairy products for 2 weeks relieves them. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may do other tests, such as: Hydrogen breath test. Normally, people have very little hydrogen in their breath. If your body doesn't digest lactose, though, hydrogen builds in your intestines, and after a while it's in your breath. This test measures how much hydrogen is in your breath after you have a lactose-loaded drink several times in a few hours. If your levels are high 3 to 5 hours later, your body does not digest lactose well. Lactose tolerance test. When your body breaks down lactose, it releases sugar into your blood. This tests how much sugar is in your blood. After you fast, a small sample of blood is taken. Then, you drink a liquid that is high in lactose. Two hours later, you give another blood sample. Because lactose causes blood sugar levels to rise, your blood sugar levels in this sample should be higher. If you're lactose intolerant, you'll have just a low rise in blood sugar. You can't change how well your body digests lactose, but you can cut or even stop your symptoms.

Some people find it easier to digest dairy products like cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese. Use lactose-free or reduced-lactose milk and dairy products. You can find dairy products with most of the lactose removed, or lactase added, at many grocery stores. Switch to dairy-free products. There are many nondairy options, such as almond, rice, or soy milks. Special note about infants and young children: When babies have symptoms of lactose intolerance, many children's doctors advise changing from cow's milk formula to soy milk formula until the symptoms go away, then slowly adding cow's milk formula and dairy products back into their diets.

To help make a diagnosis, some doctors simply look at your symptoms and whether avoiding dairy products for 2 weeks relieves them. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may do other tests, such as: Hydrogen breath test. Normally, people have very little hydrogen in their breath. If your body doesn't digest lactose, though, hydrogen builds in your intestines, and after a while it's in your breath. This test measures how much hydrogen is in your breath after you have a lactose-loaded drink several times in a few hours. If your levels are high 3 to 5 hours later, your body does not digest lactose well. Lactose tolerance test. When your body breaks down lactose, it releases sugar into your blood. This tests how much sugar is in your blood. After you fast, a small sample of blood is taken. Then, you drink a liquid that is high in lactose. Two hours later, you give another blood sample. Because lactose causes blood sugar levels to rise, your blood sugar levels in this sample should be higher. If you're lactose intolerant, you'll have just a low rise in blood sugar. You can't change how well your body digests lactose, but you can cut or even stop your symptoms.

Keep a food diary to help you learn how much (if any) dairy you can eat without having symptoms. Many people don't need to stop eating all dairy.

It's easier for your body to digest lactose when you eat it with other foods. So try having small amounts of milk or dairy foods with meals. Choose easier-to-digest dairy products. Some people find it easier to digest dairy products like cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese. Use lactose-free or reduced-lactose milk and dairy products. You can find dairy products with most of the lactose removed, or lactase added, at many grocery stores. Switch to dairy-free products. There are many nondairy options, such as almond, rice, or soy milks. Special note about infants and young children: When babies have symptoms of lactose intolerance, many children's doctors advise changing from cow's milk formula to soy milk formula until the symptoms go away, then slowly adding cow's milk formula and dairy products back into their diets.

This is a process called fermentation. Bacteria turn the alcohol into acetic acid. That's what gives vinegar its sour taste and strong smell. Apple cider vinegar has a long history as a home remedy, used to treat things like sore throat and varicose veins. There isn't much science to support the claims. But in recent years, some researchers have been taking a closer look at apple cider vinegar and its possible benefits. Some people say the âmother,â the cloud of yeast and bacteria you might see in a bottle of apple cider vinegar, is what makes it healthy. These things are probiotic, meaning they might give your digestive system a boost, but there isn't enough research to back up the other claims. Vinegar is used in cooking, baking, and salad dressings and as a preservative. There's a lot of acid in it, so drinking vinegar straight isn't recommended. It can cause problems, like eroding the enamel of your teeth, if you get too much. If you're looking to use it for health reasons, most people say to add 1 to 2 tablespoons to water or tea. Vinegar has been used as a remedy for centuries. The ancient Greeks treated wounds with it. In recent years, people have explored apple cider vinegar as a way to lose weight, improve heart health, and even treat dandruff. Research doesn't back most of these claims. But some studies have found that the acetic acid may help with a variety of conditions: Japanese scientists found that drinking vinegar might help fight obesity. One small study found that vinegar improved blood sugar and insulin levels in a group of people with type 2 diabetes. Vinegar also has chemicals known as polyphenols. They help stop the cell damage that can lead to other diseases, like cancer. But studies on whether vinegar actually lowers your chances of having cancer are mixed. Because of its high acidity, drinking a lot of apple cider vinegar can damage your teeth, hurt your throat, and upset your stomach. Also: Though some studies have been promising, there's still little to prove that drinking apple cider vinegar helps you lose weight. It may also cause your potassium levels to drop too low. Your muscles and nerves need that nutrient to work the way they should. Another study of people with type 1 diabetes found that apple cider vinegar slows the rate food and liquids move out of your stomach to your intestines. Slower digestion makes it harder to control your blood sugar level. It might cause some medications to not work as well. These include diabetes and heart disease drugs as well as diuretics (medicines that help your body get rid of water and salt) and laxatives. And of course, its strong taste might not be for everyone.

People with OCD can have either obsessive thoughts and urges or compulsive, repetitive behaviors. Some have both obsessions and compulsions. OCD isn't about habits like biting your nails or always thinking negative thoughts. The disorder can affect your job, school, and relationships and keep you from living a normal life. Your thoughts and actions are beyond your control. An obsessive thought, for example, is to think that your family members might get hurt if they don't put their clothing on in the exact same order every morning. A compulsive habit, on the other hand, might be to wash your hands 7 times after touching something that might be dirty. Although you may not want to think or do these things, you feel powerless to stop. Many people with OCD know that their thoughts and habits don't make sense. They don't do them because they enjoy them, but because they can't quit. And if they do stop, they feel so bad that they start again. Obsessions and compulsions can involve many different things, like a need for order or cleanness, hoarding, and intrusive thoughts about sex, religion, violence, and body parts. Obsessive thoughts can include: Fear of germs or getting dirty Worries about getting hurt or others being hurt Need for things to be placed in an exact order Belief that certain numbers or colors are âgoodâ or âbadâ Constant awareness of blinking, breathing, or other body sensations Unfounded suspicion that a partner is unfaithful Compulsive habits can include: Washing hands many times in a row Doing tasks in a specific order every time, or a certain âgoodâ number of times Repetitive checking on a locked door, light switch, and other things Need to count things, like steps or bottles Putting items in an exact order, like cans with labels facing front Fear of touching doorknobs, using public toilets, or shaking hands Doctors aren't sure why some people have OCD. Certain areas in the brain may not look normal in people with OCD, but more research is needed. OCD is slightly more common in women than in men. Symptoms often appear in teens or young adults. Stress can make symptoms worse. There may be a gene or genes linked to OCD, but this is still unknown. You are more likely to get the disorder if you have: A parent, sibling, or child with OCD Depression, anxiety or tics Experience with trauma A history of physical or sexual abuse as a child Your doctor may do a physical exam and bloodwork to make sure that your symptoms aren't caused by something else.

If there isn't one in your area, you can work with your child's pediatrician and a rheumatologist. Physical therapists, rehabilitation specialists called physiatrists, and occupational therapists can also help. The doctor will recommend a treatment plan to ease swelling, maintain full movement in the affected joints, relieve pain, and identify, treat, and prevent complications. Most children with JRA need medication and physical therapy to reach these goals. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), including ibuprofen and naproxen, and other prescription drugs, are often the first type of medication used. Most doctors don't treat children with aspirin because it could cause bleeding problems, stomach upset, liver problems, or Reye's syndrome. But for some children, aspirin in the correct dose, measured by blood tests, can control JRA symptoms with few serious side effects. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs) are often used if NSAIDs don't provide enough relief. DMARDs may keep JRA from getting worse. But because they take weeks or months to relieve symptoms, they're often taken with an NSAID. Methotrexate is usually the main DMARD doctors prescribe for JRA. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may help children with severe JRA. These drugs can help stop serious symptoms such as inflammation of the lining around the heart (pericarditis).

Steroids can hamper a child's normal growth and can cause other side effects, such as a round face, weight gain, weakened bones, and a greater chance of infection.

Biologics suppress the overactive immune system, targeting proteins that trigger inflammation. Your child's JRA treatment should include physical therapy. It helps keep their muscles strong so that their joints can move as well as possible. A physiatrist or a physical therapist can create an exercise program for your child. The specialist also may recommend using splints and other devices to help maintain normal bone and joint growth. Some alternative or complementary approaches for JRA, such as acupuncture, may help a child handle some of the stress of living with an ongoing illness. The National Institutes of Health ( NIH) considers acupuncture an acceptable additional treatment for arthritis. Studies show it eases pain, may lower the need for painkillers, and can boost flexibility in affected joints. But it doesn't stop joint damage from getting worse with some forms of JRA.

Acupuncture is a procedure where a practitioner inserts very thin needles into specific points on your skin. Some scientists say that acupuncture triggers the release of the body's natural painkillers. Acupuncture has been shown to offer relief from chronic pain and is sometimes used by people with neuropathy, the painful nerve damage that can happen with diabetes. Biofeedback is a technique that helps you become more aware of -- and learn to deal with -- your body's response to pain. This therapy emphasizes relaxation and stress-reduction techniques. Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that some professionals who use biofeedback also practice. With guided imagery, you'll think of peaceful mental images, such as ocean waves, or perhaps images of controlling or curing your disease. People using this technique say these positive images can ease their condition. The benefit of taking chromiumhas been studied and debated for several years. You need the mineral to make glucose tolerance factor, which helps insulin work better. Several studies suggest that chromium supplements may improve diabetes control, but we don't have enough information to recommend it to treat diabetes yet. Several types of plants are referred to as ginseng, but most studies have used American ginseng. They've shown some sugar-lowering effects in fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, as well as in A1c results (average blood sugar levels over a 3-month period). But we need larger and more long-term studies. Researchers also found that the amount of sugar-lowering compound in ginseng plants varies widely. Although the relationship between magnesiumand diabetes has been studied for decades, we still don't fully understand it. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. And evidence suggests that a magnesium deficiency may contribute to some diabetes complications. People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. Early studies showed that vanadium normalized blood sugar levels in animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When people with diabetes were given vanadium, they had a modest increase in insulin sensitivity and were able to lower their need for insulin. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages. Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control. Most plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. People with type 2 diabetes may focus on: Brewer's yeast Buckwheat Broccoli and other related greens Cinnamon Cloves Coffee Okra Leafy greens Fenugreek seeds Sage Some studies show that certain plant foods may help your body fight inflammation and use insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Cinnamon extracts can improve sugar metabolism, triggering insulin release, which also boosts cholesterol metabolism. Clove oil extracts (eugenol) have been found to help insulin work and to lower glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. An unidentified compound in coffee (not caffeine) may enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The scientific evidence thus far doesn't support the role of garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle for blood sugar control in people with diabetes. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first. Since being overweight and having diabetes are linked, many people with diabetes turn to natural alternative therapies that claim to help with weight loss, including: Chitosan Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) Chromium Pyruvate Germander Momordica charantia ( Chinese bitter melon) Sauropus androgynus (sweet leaf bush) Aristolochic acid There are also skin patch (transdermal) systems as well as oral sprays that supposedly curb your appetite and make it easier to lose weight. What's the bottom line? Check with your doctor, because many of these so-called \"obesity remedies\" haven't been studied, aren't effective, or just aren't safe. In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke. Chitosan comes from seashells and can bind to fat to prevent absorption. Studies thus far haven't been encouraging for weight loss though. Germander, Momordica charantia, Sauropus androgynus, and aristolochic acid have been linked with liver disease, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease. A survey of herbal preparations for obesity found that many had lead or arsenic and other toxic metals. Some also had other ingredients that weren't included on the label. And sometimes, the wrong plant was listed.

Several types of plants are referred to as ginseng, but most studies have used American ginseng. They've shown some sugar-lowering effects in fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, as well as in A1c results (average blood sugar levels over a 3-month period). But we need larger and more long-term studies. Researchers also found that the amount of sugar-lowering compound in ginseng plants varies widely. Although the relationship between magnesiumand diabetes has been studied for decades, we still don't fully understand it. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. And evidence suggests that a magnesium deficiency may contribute to some diabetes complications. People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. Early studies showed that vanadium normalized blood sugar levels in animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When people with diabetes were given vanadium, they had a modest increase in insulin sensitivity and were able to lower their need for insulin. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages. Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control. Most plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. People with type 2 diabetes may focus on: Brewer's yeast Buckwheat Broccoli and other related greens Cinnamon Cloves Coffee Okra Leafy greens Fenugreek seeds Sage Some studies show that certain plant foods may help your body fight inflammation and use insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Cinnamon extracts can improve sugar metabolism, triggering insulin release, which also boosts cholesterol metabolism. Clove oil extracts (eugenol) have been found to help insulin work and to lower glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. An unidentified compound in coffee (not caffeine) may enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The scientific evidence thus far doesn't support the role of garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle for blood sugar control in people with diabetes. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first. Since being overweight and having diabetes are linked, many people with diabetes turn to natural alternative therapies that claim to help with weight loss, including: Chitosan Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) Chromium Pyruvate Germander Momordica charantia ( Chinese bitter melon) Sauropus androgynus (sweet leaf bush) Aristolochic acid There are also skin patch (transdermal) systems as well as oral sprays that supposedly curb your appetite and make it easier to lose weight. What's the bottom line? Check with your doctor, because many of these so-called \"obesity remedies\" haven't been studied, aren't effective, or just aren't safe. In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke. Chitosan comes from seashells and can bind to fat to prevent absorption. Studies thus far haven't been encouraging for weight loss though. Germander, Momordica charantia, Sauropus androgynus, and aristolochic acid have been linked with liver disease, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease. A survey of herbal preparations for obesity found that many had lead or arsenic and other toxic metals. Some also had other ingredients that weren't included on the label. And sometimes, the wrong plant was listed.

Although the relationship between magnesiumand diabetes has been studied for decades, we still don't fully understand it. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. And evidence suggests that a magnesium deficiency may contribute to some diabetes complications. People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. Early studies showed that vanadium normalized blood sugar levels in animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When people with diabetes were given vanadium, they had a modest increase in insulin sensitivity and were able to lower their need for insulin. Researchers want to understand how vanadium works in the body, find potential side effects, and set safe dosages. Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control. Most plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. People with type 2 diabetes may focus on: Brewer's yeast Buckwheat Broccoli and other related greens Cinnamon Cloves Coffee Okra Leafy greens Fenugreek seeds Sage Some studies show that certain plant foods may help your body fight inflammation and use insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Cinnamon extracts can improve sugar metabolism, triggering insulin release, which also boosts cholesterol metabolism. Clove oil extracts (eugenol) have been found to help insulin work and to lower glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. An unidentified compound in coffee (not caffeine) may enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The scientific evidence thus far doesn't support the role of garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle for blood sugar control in people with diabetes. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first. Since being overweight and having diabetes are linked, many people with diabetes turn to natural alternative therapies that claim to help with weight loss, including: Chitosan Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) Chromium Pyruvate Germander Momordica charantia ( Chinese bitter melon) Sauropus androgynus (sweet leaf bush) Aristolochic acid There are also skin patch (transdermal) systems as well as oral sprays that supposedly curb your appetite and make it easier to lose weight. What's the bottom line? Check with your doctor, because many of these so-called \"obesity remedies\" haven't been studied, aren't effective, or just aren't safe. In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke. Chitosan comes from seashells and can bind to fat to prevent absorption. Studies thus far haven't been encouraging for weight loss though. Germander, Momordica charantia, Sauropus androgynus, and aristolochic acid have been linked with liver disease, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease. A survey of herbal preparations for obesity found that many had lead or arsenic and other toxic metals. Some also had other ingredients that weren't included on the label.

Coenzyme Q10, often referred to as Co Q10 (other names include ubiquinone and ubiquinol), is a vitamin-like substance that's in meats and seafood. Co Q10 helps cells make energy and acts as an antioxidant. But it hasn't been shown to affect blood sugar control. Most plant foods are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. People with type 2 diabetes may focus on: Brewer's yeast Buckwheat Broccoli and other related greens Cinnamon Cloves Coffee Okra Leafy greens Fenugreek seeds Sage Some studies show that certain plant foods may help your body fight inflammation and use insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar. Cinnamon extracts can improve sugar metabolism, triggering insulin release, which also boosts cholesterol metabolism. Clove oil extracts (eugenol) have been found to help insulin work and to lower glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. An unidentified compound in coffee (not caffeine) may enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The scientific evidence thus far doesn't support the role of garlic, ginger, ginseng, hawthorn, or nettle for blood sugar control in people with diabetes. If you're considering eating or using any plant-based remedies, talk to your doctor first. Since being overweight and having diabetes are linked, many people with diabetes turn to natural alternative therapies that claim to help with weight loss, including: Chitosan Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) Chromium Pyruvate Germander Momordica charantia ( Chinese bitter melon) Sauropus androgynus (sweet leaf bush) Aristolochic acid There are also skin patch (transdermal) systems as well as oral sprays that supposedly curb your appetite and make it easier to lose weight. What's the bottom line? Check with your doctor, because many of these so-called \"obesity remedies\" haven't been studied, aren't effective, or just aren't safe. In 2003, ephedrine -- also known as ma huang -- became the first herbal stimulant ever banned by the FDA. It was a popular component of over-the-counter weight loss drugs. Ephedrine had some benefits, but it could cause far more harm, especially in high doses: insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep), high blood pressure, glaucoma, and urinary retention. This herbal supplement has also been associated with numerous cases of stroke. Chitosan comes from seashells and can bind to fat to prevent absorption. Studies thus far haven't been encouraging for weight loss though. Germander, Momordica charantia, Sauropus androgynus, and aristolochic acid have been linked with liver disease, pulmonary disease, and kidney disease. A survey of herbal preparations for obesity found that many had lead or arsenic and other toxic metals. Some also had other ingredients that weren't included on the label. And sometimes, the wrong plant was listed. You should talk to your doctor about any drugs, herbal products, or alternative and complementary treatments to make sure they're not going to interfere with your treatment or cause other problems.

The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, defines complementary and alternative medicine as a \"group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine.\" Complementary medicine is used with conventional treatments, whereas alternative medicine is used instead of conventional medicine. Although some may be effective, others aren't or can even be harmful. If you want to try complementary or alternative medicine, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons and what may be a good idea for you. Acupuncture is a procedure where a practitioner inserts very thin needles into specific points on your skin. Some scientists say that acupuncture triggers the release of the body's natural painkillers. Acupuncture has been shown to offer relief from chronic pain and is sometimes used by people with neuropathy, the painful nerve damage that can happen with diabetes. Biofeedback is a technique that helps you become more aware of -- and learn to deal with -- your body's response to pain. This therapy emphasizes relaxation and stress-reduction techniques. Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that some professionals who use biofeedback also practice. With guided imagery, you'll think of peaceful mental images, such as ocean waves, or perhaps images of controlling or curing your disease. People using this technique say these positive images can ease their condition. The benefit of taking chromiumhas been studied and debated for several years. You need the mineral to make glucose tolerance factor, which helps insulin work better. Several studies suggest that chromium supplements may improve diabetes control, but we don't have enough information to recommend it to treat diabetes yet. Several types of plants are referred to as ginseng, but most studies have used American ginseng. They've shown some sugar-lowering effects in fasting and after-meal blood sugar levels, as well as in A1c results (average blood sugar levels over a 3-month period). But we need larger and more long-term studies. Researchers also found that the amount of sugar-lowering compound in ginseng plants varies widely. Although the relationship between magnesiumand diabetes has been studied for decades, we still don't fully understand it. Low magnesium may worsen blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. Scientists say that it interrupts insulin secretion in the pancreas and builds insulin resistance in the body's tissues. And evidence suggests that a magnesium deficiency may contribute to some diabetes complications. People who get more magnesium in their diet (by eating whole grains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Vanadium is a compound found in tiny amounts in plants and animals. Early studies showed that vanadium normalized blood sugar levels in animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. When people with diabetes were given vanadium, they had a modest increase in insulin sensitivity and were able to lower their need for insulin.

Soy formulas contain soy protein along with: Carbohydrates Amino acids Vitamins Minerals They're an option for babies who: Are lactose-intolerant -- meaning their bodies can't break down a sugar called lactose in cow's milk Have galactosemia -- a disorder that keeps them from breaking down a sugar called galactose in milk Are allergic to cow's milk (however, about half of babies who are allergic to cow's milk are also allergic to soy) There is no evidence that soy-based formulas can help with issues like colic or a stomach bug.

The milk proteins in these formulas have already been broken down so baby doesn't have an allergic reaction to them. Partially hydrolyzed formulas contain proteins that have been partly broken down to make them easier for babies to digest.

Or do you need a prescription? Both prescribed and OTC drugs are regulated by the FDA to ensure that they're safe and effective when you follow the directions. But all medications have side effects. Some medications can cause problems when you're taking other medicines, too. Given all the options and things to consider, it's best to work with your doctor or allergy specialist to figure out whether an OTC or prescription medication is right for you. You'll want to tell them about your symptoms and any medicines you've tried in the past. You don't need a prescription to buy OTC medicine. For the medications that you think of as prescription, you do. Sometimes, the same drug comes in both OTC and prescription versions. The difference is often the strength. For example, hydrocortisone can treat skin reactions including itching and redness. If you're bothered by an insect bite, you can get an OTC cream or spray with a concentration of 1% or less. But for a more severe reaction like eczema, your doctor may prescribe 2.5% hydrocortisone cream or ointment. In other cases, a prescription medication works in a different way than what you can buy over the counter. If you have hay fever, you can treat the sneezing and stuffy, itchy nose with an OTC antihistamine such as cetirizine ( Zyrtec), fexofenadine ( Allegra), or loratadine ( Claritin). These block chemicals called histamines, which your body releases when your allergy is triggered. Or your doctor could prescribe a medication like montelukast ( Singulair), which blocks a different chemical so your body won't react as much. Another difference might be how long it takes for you to feel better. Those OTC antihistamines typically start working in about an hour, but it may be a couple of days before the prescription really kicks in. Most OTC medicines, including antihistamines and nasal steroids, are safe to use as directed for as long as your symptoms last, but there are some exceptions. Don't use a decongestant nasal spray for more than 3 days unless your doctor says to. It could stop working and make your stuffiness worse. Talk to your doctor about other potential risks. One study found a link between dementia and using high doses of some OTC antihistamines for many years, such as diphenhydramine ( Benadryl). When your allergies could be life-threatening or get in the way of living your life, you should see a specialist, called an allergist. You may need a prescription if your allergy symptoms are: Several months out of the year Causing a stuffy nose, trouble breathing, or sinus infections that won't go away Affecting your day-to-day activities Not controlled by OTC medications, or those medicines cause unpleasant side effects If you're taking a prescription medicine for your allergies, ask your doctor before you also take an OTC medication, especially an antihistamine, for those same symptoms. Using some medicines together can cause more side effects or even set off a dangerous reaction. Tell your doctor about everything you take: all the pain relievers, remedies, vitamins, and supplements, too. Your doctor might also write a prescription for an OTC medicine so that it's covered by your health insurance. You'll need to check the rules for your plan -- your copay and your flexible spending account or your health savings account -- to figure out what's going to cost less. Kids may be able to use the same OTC products as adults, but in smaller doses. Follow the directions on the label. Some OTC medicines are made specifically for children, like antihistamine syrups and chewable tablets.

And because there's no cure, getting the proper treatment early is the best way to improve chances of managing the illness. Schizophrenia treatment will center on managing the person's symptoms. To do that, they'll probably need to take medication for an open-ended period of time, possibly even for life. Psychotherapy, a kind of talk therapy, will likely also be a big part of the plan to help them understand and manage their symptoms. There's more than one kind of psychotherapy and many types of medications, so you'll want to know what's involved. Individual psychotherapy . During sessions, a therapist or psychiatrist can teach the person how to deal with their thoughts and behaviors. They'll learn more about their illness and its effects, as well as how to tell the difference between what's real and what's not. It also can help them manage everyday life. Cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT). This can help the person change their thinking and behavior. A therapist will show them ways to deal with voices and hallucinations. With a combination of CBT sessions and medication, they can eventually tell what triggers their psychotic episodes (times when hallucinations or delusions flare up) and how to reduce or stop them. Cognitive enhancement therapy ( CET). This type of therapy is also called cognitive remediation. It teaches people how to better recognize social cues, or triggers, and improve their attention, memory, and ability to organize their thoughts. It combines computer-based brain training and group sessions. If a person with schizophrenia sees improvement during psychotherapy sessions, it's likely they'll need more help learning how to become part of a community. That's where psychosocial therapy comes in. Social skills training. This type of instruction focuses on improving communication and social interactions. Rehabilitation. Schizophrenia usually develops during the years we are building our careers. So rehabilitation may include job counseling, problem-solving support, and education in money management. Family education. Your knowledge of psychosis and schizophrenia can help a friend or family member who has it. Research shows that people with schizophrenia who have a strong support system do better than those without the encouragement of friends and family. Self-help groups. You should encourage your loved one to participate in community care and outreach programs to continue working on his social skills. The National Alliance on Mental Illness ( NAMI) is an outreach organization that offers a free peer-to-peer program, for instance. It includes 10 sessions for adults with mental illness who want to learn more about their condition from people who have experienced it themselves or been through it with a loved one. Coordinated specialty care ( CSC). This is for people experiencing an episode of psychosis for the first time. It's a team approach that combines medication and psychological therapies. It includes social and employment services and tries to include the family whenever possible. The aim is to change the direction and prognosis for the disease by catching it in its earliest stages. Research shows that people with schizophrenia who get early and intensive treatment have the best long-term results. Assertive community treatment ( ACT). This offers highly personalized services to help people with schizophrenia meet life's daily challenges, like taking medications. ACT professionals also help them handle problems proactively and work to prevent crises. Social recovery therapy. This treatment puts the focus on helping the person set and achieve goals and building a sense of optimism and positive beliefs about themselves and others. These newer medications are less likely to cause certain side effects than the first-generation antipsychotics. But many medications in this family can cause weight gain and raise blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Changes in nutrition and exercise, and possibly medication intervention, can help address these side effects. They include: Aripiprazole ( Abilify) Asenapine ( Saphris) Brexpiprazole ( Rexulti) Cariprazine ( Vraylar) Clozapine ( Clozaril) Iloperidone ( Fanapt) Lurasidone ( Latuda) Olanzapine ( Zyprexa) Paliperidone ( Invega) Pimavanserin ( Nuplazid) Quetiapine ( Seroquel) Risperidone ( Risperdal) Ziprasidone ( Geodon) You might hear these drugs called typical or conventional. These medications block a brain chemical called dopamine and are more likely than second-generation antipsychotics to cause significant movement disorders like intense muscle stiffness (called dystonia) or a condition that may develop over long-term exposure called tardive dyskinesia. Drugs in this group include: Chlorpromazine ( Thorazine) Fluphenazine ( Proxlixin) Haloperidol ( Haldol) Loxapine ( Loxitane) Perphenazine ( Trilafon) Pimozide ( Orap) Thioridazine ( Mellaril) Thiothixene ( Navane) Trifluoperazine ( Stelazine) In this procedure, electrodes are attached to the person's scalp. While they're under general anesthesia, doctors send a small electric shock to the brain. A course of ECT therapy usually involves 2-3 treatments per week for several weeks. Each shock treatment causes a controlled seizure. A series of treatments over time leads to improvement in mood and thinking. Scientists don't fully understand exactly how ECT and the controlled seizures it causes help, although some researchers think that ECT-induced seizures may affect the release of neurotransmitters in the brain. It can help when medications no longer work or if severe depression or catatonia makes treating the illness difficult.", "question": "How are self-help groups used to treat schizophrenia?", "answer": ["You should encourage your loved one to participate in community care and outreach programs to continue working on his social skills.

He'll probably start with questions about your medical history. Then he'll do a physical exam of your hands, arms, shoulders, and neck. He'll try to figure out if your pain is due to another condition, like an injury or arthritis. He'll also make sure your daily activities aren't to blame. The doctor may focus on your wrist to see if the area is tender, swollen, warm, or discolored. He'll probably test each finger to see if you've lost any feeling. And he'll check the strength of the muscles in your hand. After that, he may do or order any of the following tests. They'll focus on the median nerve, which runs through your forearm into your hand. When that nerve gets pressed or squeezed through the carpal tunnel, it causes carpal tunnel syndrome. The doctor will tap or press on the median nerve in your wrist with a reflex hammer. If your fingers tingle or if you feel an electric-shock-like sensation, the test is positive. You may have carpal tunnel syndrome. This is also known as the wrist-flexion test. The doctor will tell you to press the backs of your hands and fingers together with your wrists flexed and your fingers pointed down. You'll stay that way for 1-2 minutes. If your fingers tingle or get numb, you have carpal tunnel syndrome. This means you can tell if two objects touching your skin are two distinct points instead of just one. Your doctor may use a gadget called a 2-point disk-criminator, a small, flat, eight-sided tool with needle-like prongs sticking out from all sides. He might do the test several times on each finger. He'll start with two points touching your skin a few centimeters apart and move them closer together until you feel just one point of pressure. The distance at which you can feel only one point will help him figure out nerve function and compression -- two important components of carpal tunnel syndrome. This test provides some of the strongest evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome. It measures how fast an electric signal can travel along a nerve or from the nerve to a muscle. The doctor places a small electrode on your skin near your elbow. It sends a mild electrical current down your median nerve. The more time it takes for the current to travel from your elbow to your fingers, the more damage to your median nerve. This works like part two of the nerve conduction velocity test. It measures how well the muscle around your median nerve works. The doctor places a small needle electrode into muscles in your hand and arm that get impulses from the median nerve. The needle sends electric impulses into the muscle. You relax and flex your hand several times. The doctor can tell if your median nerve is damaged or being squeezed. The needles might hurt a little, but it should stop once the doctor takes them out. You may feel twitches or spasms from the electrical current. You could have some bruising where the electrode went in, but that should go away within a few days. Your doctor may order one of these tests to rule out other causes of wrist and hand pain. An X-ray can show arthritis or a broken bone. An ultrasound or MRI will show a swollen or compressed median nerve.

But how cautious should you be about germs and illness when traveling with kids in the U. S.? Experts agree that a few major precautions, like washing hands frequently, are critical to keeping nasty germs from making children ill while traveling. But beyond those, how careful you are about germs on the road depends on how careful you are about germs at home. If you don't mind your children crawling around in other people's homes, it's probably not a big deal for them to crawl around in a hotel as long as you check first for safety hazards and wash their hands afterward. But what if the thought of your child touching a hotel room floor or snuggling up in an airplane blanket makes you feel ill? You may be more comfortable taking more measures, experts say. And some children are just more prone to illness when traveling than others. In either case, you'll probably feel more comfortable taking extra care. Here are some strategies you can use to help keep illness at bay when traveling with healthy children. If you are planning to travel with a newborn infant or a child with a compromised immune system, talk to your child's doctor first about special precautions. Are children more vulnerable to illness when traveling? Yes, and experts point to two main reasons: Most children are not particularly good about keeping things out of their mouths, and they aren't particularly careful with hand hygiene. In addition, children's immune systems are less developed than those of adults, and this makes them more vulnerable to illness. These three strategies can help protect them: Make sure your child is up to date on immunizations, even when traveling in the U. S. Be sure your child has had routine vaccinations for measles, whooping cough, and other serious illnesses on the normal CDC schedule. And anyone in your travel party who hasn't gotten a yearly flu shot should consider getting one before heading out. The CDC recommends an annual flu shot for everyone six months old and older. A flu shot provides double benefits. It protects your child and helps cut down on the general level of flu being transmitted. Practice good hand hygiene. Washing hands often, especially before meals, is the No. 1 way to prevent illness, at home or while traveling. Of course, you should help small children wash hands and teach older kids how to wash them thoroughly. Using warm soap and water, lather up and scrub all over for 20 seconds, then rinse and dry. While you're at it, encourage your kids not to put dirty hands -- or other things -- in their mouth. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Children should wash their hands with soap and water when they can, but you should have a sanitizing gel or wipes with at least 60% alcohol available when soap and water aren't. This is especially important in places where it may be difficult to get to a restroom, such as at amusement parks or even on airplanes. Make sure children rub hand sanitizer all over their hands until dry. If you can see dirt on their hands, however, hand sanitizers won't be enough. Hand sanitizers are dangerous for children if they swallow any, so store them in a bag safely away from small children, and supervise their use. Airplanes have gotten a reputation as flying cold-and-flu factories. But it's actually hard to determine just what role they play in making children, or adults, sick during travel. Experts agree that when kids have more contact with other people, they're more likely to get sick. But that can happen anywhere there are lots of people -- including malls, restaurants, or rest stops. Concerns about airplane germs often focus on air quality. A 2008 study of cabin-air bacteria in 12 commercial airplanes showed, though, they do not pose a risk for healthy passengers. And experts say your risk of getting a respiratory infection is higher on a bus or in an airport than on a plane. A bigger concern, according to some experts, is airplane surfaces. The majority of infections, including respiratory infections, are passed by contact occurring within a very short distance rather than through the air. Consider these measures if you're concerned about airplane germs: Sanitize \"high touch\" areas. Germs linger longer on nonporous materials like plastic. Wipe down surfaces such as tray tables, seat armrests, and lavatory door handles with an alcohol-based wipe or gel before your child uses them. With the short cleaning time between flights, these areas do not always get cleaned and disinfected. Avoid touching restroom surfaces. When washing your child's hands in an airplane or other public restroom, turn off the faucet with a paper towel. Then use another paper towel to dry hands and open the door. Bring your own blankets and pillows. If airplane blankets or pillows aren't delivered to you in a package, chances are they've been used. Having a familiar blanket and pillow to curl up with may also make children more comfortable during air travel. Drink bottled water. In water quality tests on 158 airplanes in 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA) discovered coliform bacteria and E. coli in some water samples. In 2009, the EPA established tougher rules for airplane water. Generally, however, the numbers of food- and water-borne illnesses from airplane travel are low. Ask sick passengers near you to observe cold and flu etiquette. If someone near you isn't covering coughs or sneezes, ask him to, even if it makes you feel awkward to do so. And be sure you do the same. Also, make sure your child coughs or sneezes into a tissue or her elbow and washes her hands afterward. Put distance between your child and sick passengers. Ask the flight attendant if you and your child can move to another row. If that's not possible, take the seat next to the sick person instead of putting your child there. You're likely to be more conscious of what you touch and how to prevent infection. Hotels. One study found that when people with colds stayed overnight in hotel rooms, many surfaces remained contaminated with rhinovirus for at least a day. But how concerned should you be? Health experts point out that most hotel rooms are better cleaned than most homes. Towels and sheets are changed daily, and the room is cleaned somewhat every day. Still, experts suggest wiping down remote controls, light switches, telephones, doorknobs, toilet seat handles, faucet handles, and other high-touch areas as a precaution when traveling with children. Amusement parks. Be careful what you eat. Avoid food that may have been sitting out for a long time. Since you can't wipe down germy surfaces at amusement parks, hand hygiene is especially important. Swimming pools and water parks. Have kids rinse off before and after taking the plunge at pools and water parks. These can be breeding grounds for pinkeye (conjunctivitis), skin viruses, and cryptosporidium and giardia, which cause diarrhea. Chlorination does not kill all bacteria. Also teach young children to avoid swallowing water in pools and water parks. Too many treats, not enough sleep, and being on the go can wear down children's immunity. This can make them more vulnerable to illness. These strategies can help kids stay healthy on the road: Encourage children to drink liquids. Stick closely to your child's normal, healthy diet. This not only gives kids nutrients to help fight infection -- it can also help prevent diarrhea or constipation, which children are prone to when traveling. Consider bringing your kids' favorite healthy foods on road trips or airplanes instead of buying fast food or snacks. Don't skimp on sleep. Sticking to your children's normal bedtime and naptime will help them sleep better. Packing favorite stuffed animals or blankets can also help children sleep in strange places so they get enough rest. Whatever strategies you use to keep harmful bacteria at bay, try to keep germs and illness in perspective. It's not uncommon for healthy children, especially under age 5, to get several colds a year -- and usually not from strangers on the road. Most often infections come from the people we love.", "question": "How can you avoid hotel germs when you travel?", "answer": ["Health experts point out that most hotel rooms are better cleaned than most homes.

You may have spent years trying to hide your symptoms, and think they're too embarrassing to talk about. But people who care about you are an important source of support. Be open with your family and close friends about what you feel, physically and emotionally. It's natural to fear what others might say. But keeping things inside only adds to your stress. Also, consider other ways to handle your situation: See a professional counselor for help with your feelings and to find ways to handle stress. Look for a support group or online forum. You can share your experience with people who know what you're going through. They may have tips on how to deal with the things you're worried about. Plan how you'd like to explain your condition to an acquaintance or respond to a comment from a stranger. Practice saying it to family or friends until you feel comfortable. It may help to let people know that HS isn't contagious and has nothing to do with bad hygiene. For some people, HS brings feelings of anger, anxiety, and depression. It can be hard to stop negative thoughts once they start. Try these strategies: Acknowledge your feelings. Notice what emotions you're having, and know that it's OK to feel them. Learn your triggers. Pay attention to the things that bring on negative thoughts and emotions. Maybe you can avoid them. Challenge negative thoughts. Ask yourself if you might be wrong, or if there's another way to look at the issue. Be kind to yourself. Think about what you'd tell your best friend if she said the same things about herself. Don't turn to alcohol, drugs, or food for comfort. It can take someone years to find out that they have hidradenitis suppurativa. Some people are too embarrassed to talk to their doctor about their symptoms. It's also easy to mistake HS for a different skin problem. Getting the right diagnosis can be a relief. It can also be hard to find the right treatment. Be open with your doctor about your symptoms and how they affect your daily life. It may help to write down what you want to talk about. And speak up if you don't get relief. You may need to find a doctor who specializes in HS. HS can bring unpredictable flare-ups. Take positive steps to feel more in control: Get to a healthy weight.

You might have: Loss of appetite Nausea Discomfort in your belly Dark urine Clay-colored bowel movements Yellowing of the skin and eyes (called jaundice) If you have long-term hepatitis C, it could lead to scarring of your liver, called cirrhosis. You get it by eating or drinking something that's got the virus in it. You get it when blood from someone who's infected gets into your body. For instance, you can catch it if you share needles when using illegal drugs. You can also get hepatitis B if you have sex without using a condom with someone who's got it. If you're pregnant and you've got hepatitis B, you could pass it to your child during birth. Like hepatitis B, you get this type when the blood of someone who's infected enters your body. This can happen through sharing needles when using illegal drugs. An infected mother can also give the disease to her newborn child during birth. The hepatitis A virus can live outside the body for months. Hepatitis B survives for at least 7 days while still being able to cause an infection. Hepatitis C can live outside the body for up to 4 days and still spread the disease. Studies show that a vaccine will prevent the disease for at least 20 years. But booster doses aren't routinely recommended. If you have long-term hepatitis B you might be a \"carrier,\" which means you can infect others. No. If for some reason you stop your vaccines in the middle of the series, you can resume with the next dose.

The goal is to get your blood sugar level out of the prediabetes range, and keep it that way. What you do every day makes a big difference.
