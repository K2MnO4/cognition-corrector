For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.\n To help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:\n Physical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance. Blood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that drop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.\n You may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.\n Biopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a laboratory.\n If you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may advise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.\n Imaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:\n Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is conducted in a tube-shaped machine. Doppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels. Positron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.", "GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.\n The high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be reduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.\n Actemra (tocilizumab) was approved May 2017 by the FDA to treat adults with giant cell arteritis."], "generated_answer": " in adults?

Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D. Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families. The odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia. In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families. Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.", "Although the etiology of FM remains unknown, it is thought to involve some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure that triggers further alterations in gene expression. Because FM shows marked familial aggregation, most previous research has focused on genetic predisposition to FM and has revealed associations between genetic factors and the development of FM, including specific gene polymorphisms involved in the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic pathways. The aim of this review was to discuss the current evidence regarding genetic factors that may play a role in the development and symptom severity of FM.", "That's why it can take a long time to go from fibromyalgia symptoms to a fibromyalgia diagnosis. Fibromyalgia can't be easily confirmed or ruled out through a simple laboratory test. Your doctor can't detect it in your blood or see it on an X-ray. Instead, fibromyalgia appears to be linked to changes in how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals. Because there is no test for fibromyalgia, your doctor must rely solely on your group of symptoms to make a diagnosis. Because a genetic factor appears to be involved in fibromyalgia, your doctor may also want to know if any other members of your immediate family have experienced similar symptoms."], "generated_answer": "\nA genetic test to detect fibromyalgia involves genetic testing.

Some (rare) causes of dementia are very clearly 'inherited', for example, Huntington's disease. This is an 'autosomal dominant' disease which means that only one faulty copy of the gene is needed in order to inherit the disease.\n If you have inherited the gene you will get the disease if you live long enough. It does not skip a generation. Some other dementias have both inherited and non-inherited forms. In the case of fronto-temporal dementias, 30 to 50 per cent of cases are inherited.

But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.\n Symptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma If you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.\n Your symptoms may include: * Wheezing * Tight chest * Cough * Shortness of breath * Chest pain (rarely)\n Triggers People with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through your nose, triggering asthma symptoms.\n Air pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues. Even the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended. These include: * Hiking * Baseball * Golf * Walking * Leisure biking\n Because cold, dry air can make symptoms worse, as can activities that require continuous exertion, it is recommended that individuals with EIB avoid sports like: * Cross-country skiing * Running * Soccer * Basketball * Hockey", "Fortunately, having asthma, even exercise-induced asthma, doesn't have to keep you out of the game.

Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.\n Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.\n Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.\n Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries.

Jock itch may spread to the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort. Symptoms include: Red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze; patches often have sharply-defined edges with scale at the edges. Patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center. Abnormally dark or light skin. Sometimes, these changes are permanent.", "Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections How you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the skin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n Yeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your groin, between your genitals and thighs.\n Other fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.\n How to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.\n Pat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.\n Itchy Crotch Cause: Chafing How you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.\n The rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.\n How to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.\n Pair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.\n Itchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo How you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That moisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.\n How to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.\n If the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.\n Itchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis How you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says Dr. Reichenberg.\n Contact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll usually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.\n You'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.\n How to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.\n If contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.\n Itchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice How you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.\n You may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough to look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n How to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.\n Itchy Crotch Cause: Herpes How you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the blisters can break, leading to painful sores.\n If you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.\n How to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.\n There's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.\n Itchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts How you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than some itching, the warts don't feel like anything.\n How to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.\n Or, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.\n However, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.\n This article originally appeared on MensHealth.com."], "generated_answer": "Yes No\n\nA scrotum lump is inflammation of a pituitary gland.

The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a malignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented. Affected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.\n 2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as malignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.\n In addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.\n 3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died. The median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for males (range 9-79 years), not significantly different. The predominant causes of death included respiratory failure from chronic lung disease, lymphoid or other malignancy, or overwhelming infections (TABLE 6). To further examine the mortality of this cohort, we compared those with known long term follow-up, 226 females (48%) and 185 males (39%) to age-matched population controls. The survival of both male (p=0.0001) and female (p=0.0001) CVID subjects was significantly reduced as compared to 1994 United States reference information.34 (FIGURE 1) The risk of death in this interval was nearly 11 times higher for CVID patients with one or more of the non-infectious complications, than for subjects who had infections only (HR=10.96; p=0.0001) (TABLE 7). Kaplan-Meier Analysis confirmed this observation, with a long term survival of 95% for patients without versus 42% for those with non-infectious complications (FIGURE 2). These data agree with a previous study on CVID subjects from the ESID registry.7 However, we found here that not all complications were associated with reduced survival. Patients with gastrointestinal disease (HR 2.78; p=0.0004), liver disease/hepatitis (HR 2.48; p=0.0003), lymphoma (HR 2.44; p=0.001), chronic lung disease including radiological and/or functional lung disease as described above (HR 2.06; p=0.001), or malabsorption (HR 2.06; p=0.022) had reduced survival in this interval, as compared to CVID patients without these particular complications.

Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia associated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.\n\n 2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.\n\n\n 3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome architecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1).

The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal events, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.\n Syncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss of consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar stroke). The typical signs of epileptic seizures include dejavu, tongue lacerations, limb jerking, and postictal confusion but not common signs of syncope, such as prodromal diaphoresis, palpitations, or provocation by prolonged sitting or standing. Although limb jerking is noted in 15 percent of syncopal patients, the other typical signs of seizures are absent.\n 2. Correct and early diagnosis of TIA versus mimics is critical because early interventions (e.g., antiplatelet agents, statin therapy, blood pressure-lowering therapy, anticoagulation when appropriate) can lead to an 80 percent reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events.
