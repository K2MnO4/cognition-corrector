The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.", "question": "Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?", "answer": "yes. Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "generated_answer": "free radicals are generated from the breakdown of proteins, a number of free radicals are produced by reactions within the mitochondria, with free radicals created spontaneously occurring within the body.

For example, cancer survivors are eligible for certain treatments such as breast cancer chemoprevention. Do mammograms save money on health care costs? \nThe screening cost of mammograms in the United States is higher than in some other countries, including the United Kingdom.  In addition, a single mammogram will take about 30 minutes, compared with over 10 to 15 minutes for traditional breast examinations. How do mammograms save on patient costs? \nA mammogram can help reduce the size of the breasts and the need for mammography. However, many breast cancer patients who undergo mammography will have some complications such as tenderness and swelling in the breast.  In the United States, there is limited screening to detect breast cancer in older women who have undergone surgery. In addition, cancer survival is increased if patients have regular mammograms. How long is a preventive mammogram performed in the United States? \nA preventive mammogram can be performed with or without removing the breast. The procedure will usually be repeated.

Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables. Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries.

Most of the available types of anticoagulation during pregnancy and childbirth have been designed to prevent infection. However, if left untreated, infections can lead to acute bacterial infection, which can have a variety of adverse clinical outcomes.

Histologic and ultrastructural studies of normal corneas showed significant differences in the direction of collagen fibrils and/or the degree of lamellar interweaving in Bowman's layer, the anterior third of the corneal stroma, the posterior two-thirds of the corneal stroma, and Descemet's membrane. Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring.

However, this is a very significant error, because the actual number of people aged 65 years and older in the United States is expected to reach around 40 million in 2020. Therefore, the NHEO data does not allow an accurate estimate of the costs for the uninsured and under-insured to a large extent. A study of the costs of Medicare in Canada, which includes both private health insurance and Medicaid, also shows that the number of Medicare beneficiaries includes only a very small amount of the total population. [10] This includes individuals who are younger, but not old enough to qualify for Medicaid. As a result, this finding is consistent with the previous findings of the National Committee for Health Care Cost Reduction that a relatively small number of Medicare recipients are paying out of pocket for their care.\n\nAnother important factor in the relative cost of Medicaid is the use of providers in the various medical settings that are eligible to receive this funding. Based on an analysis of hospital-based care, research by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has found that the rate of utilization increases in the late-stage of acute care, during which time patients may still be suffering, before hospital admission, with Medicaid funding.[11] In addition, the overall utilization rate of hospitals with Medicaid coverage are relatively low. Based on hospital-based data, the overall utilization of private-sector hospitals is higher than that of the Medicare and Medicaid patient population combined.[12] However, the utilization rate of hospitals with private-sector coverage does not necessarily reflect the actual costs of healthcare services. Although the amount of spending is similar in the two sectors, there are different characteristics of providers, and differences in the type and amount of care that can be provided. According to data from the Health Research & Educational Trust, a charity organization that uses a representative sample of hospital records of more than 7,300 hospitals, about 20 percent of patients with conditions commonly associated with medical errors have conditions such as cancer or diabetes that are not covered by their insurance.

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.", "question": "Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?", "answer": "yes.

In addition, a single mammogram will take about 30 minutes, compared with over 10 to 15 minutes for traditional breast examinations. How do mammograms save on patient costs? \nA mammogram can help reduce the size of the breasts and the need for mammography. However, many breast cancer patients who undergo mammography will have some complications such as tenderness and swelling in the breast.  In the United States, there is limited screening to detect breast cancer in older women who have undergone surgery. In addition, cancer survival is increased if patients have regular mammograms.

The risk of severe liver disease due to HCV infection and severe liver disease due to other causes is high in patients with a previous diagnosis of hepatitis C and is a significant risk factor for fatal liver transplantation. This risk may be especially high among people younger than 50 years of age.\n\n\nStudies suggest that hepatitis C is associated with a lower risk of the developing fatal disease. Because of these risks, those with a prior diagnosis of hepatitis C have more serious problems than people who have never had hepatitis C.

What exactly is a type of anesthesia? What are the main types of epidural anesthesia? \nWhat are the symptoms of epidural anesthesia? This question addresses the effects of epidural anesthesia on patients in labor. There are several types of medical treatments for postpartum haemorrhage. These include: (1) anticoagulants in order to prevent the re-emergence of blood clots, which can lead to stroke, and (2) anticoagulation (which helps to reduce or prevent the re-emergence of blood clots in the body). Most of the available types of anticoagulation during pregnancy and childbirth have been designed to prevent infection. However, if left untreated, infections can lead to acute bacterial infection, which can have a variety of adverse clinical outcomes. This type of therapy is usually administered with antibiotics and other drugs that help fight infection. Asking the patient about the symptoms of acute infection can also help them make an informed decision if and when to choose and implement an antibiotic treatment. This question aims to assess how long to wait before considering any further medical treatment or invasive procedures after a postpartum haemorrhage. This topic is also often the subject of debates in other forums regarding whether or not to admit a pregnant woman for emergency obstetrical consultation, as some women in labour may be unaware of the risk and severity of their condition, and others may be concerned about infection, which can lead to life-threatening infections. After all, if a woman is not aware of the consequences of being sick with a serious infection, then it is unlikely to receive proper care. Asking the patient about the outcomes of any infections and the duration of time they should be managed in the hospital following childbirth can help reduce this risk. However, it is important to note that an infection is not the only indication for antibiotics. There are many options available to manage an infection, such as: (1) the administration of antibiotics to try and prevent or reduce the infection, or (2) the administration of a vaccine. Antibiotics are most likely to be used in case they are not effective, such as when a woman has a high risk of antibiotic-", "overall comparison": "entailment"}

The medical records of 14 patients with Fournier's gangrene who presented at the University Hospital Center \"Mother Teresa\" from January 1997 to December 2006 were reviewed retrospectively to analyze the outcome and identify the risk factor and prognostic indicators of mortality. Of the 14 patients, 5 died and 9 survived. Mean age was 54 years (range from 41-61): it was 53 years in the group of survivors and 62 years in deceased group. There was a significant difference in leukocyte count between patients who survived (range 4900-17000/mm) and those died (range 20.300-31000/mm3).

It's also more common in people who have diabetes, tuberculosis, or other conditions that affect the body's immune system.\n\nIn a lot of people with gangrene, they lose some tissue to the healing process, causing the infection to spread.\n\nWhat happens if people are sick and have symptoms like chest pain, fever, weakness, or a skin infection?\n\nIf you have pneumonia, an infection of the lungs, or a sore throat, your doctor may refer you to a hospital. If you're sick, your doctor may advise you to stay home. In these cases, your doctor may suggest antibiotics and blood thinners. This medication can help prevent infections of the bloodstream.\n\nBut if you aren't ill and can keep your house clean, you may do without the antibiotic for a few days.\n\nIn some people, a bone infection can also spread to the leg. This might require amputation.\n\nWhen should I contact my doctor about my symptoms?\n\nIf you think you have a serious illness that could worsen if you don't get medical care, such as diabetes, or a urinary tract infection, tell your doctor right away.

[9] Therefore, the number of individuals included in NHEO is only about 10 percent of the overall U.S. population. However, this is a very significant error, because the actual number of people aged 65 years and older in the United States is expected to reach around 40 million in 2020. Therefore, the NHEO data does not allow an accurate estimate of the costs for the uninsured and under-insured to a large extent. A study of the costs of Medicare in Canada, which includes both private health insurance and Medicaid, also shows that the number of Medicare beneficiaries includes only a very small amount of the total population. [10] This includes individuals who are younger, but not old enough to qualify for Medicaid. As a result, this finding is consistent with the previous findings of the National Committee for Health Care Cost Reduction that a relatively small number of Medicare recipients are paying out of pocket for their care.\n\nAnother important factor in the relative cost of Medicaid is the use of providers in the various medical settings that are eligible to receive this funding. Based on an analysis of hospital-based care, research by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has found that the rate of utilization increases in the late-stage of acute care, during which time patients may still be suffering, before hospital admission, with Medicaid funding.[11] In addition, the overall utilization rate of hospitals with Medicaid coverage are relatively low. Based on hospital-based data, the overall utilization of private-sector hospitals is higher than that of the Medicare and Medicaid patient population combined.[12] However, the utilization rate of hospitals with private-sector coverage does not necessarily reflect the actual costs of healthcare services. Although the amount of spending is similar in the two sectors, there are different characteristics of providers, and differences in the type and amount of care that can be provided. According to data from the Health Research & Educational Trust, a charity organization that uses a representative sample of hospital records of more than 7,300 hospitals, about 20 percent of patients with conditions commonly associated with medical errors have conditions such as cancer or diabetes that are not covered by their insurance.
