{"id": 21645374, "url": "", "subject": "", "topic": "", "context": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.", "question": "Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?", "answer": "yes. Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "generated_answer": "and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nWhat are the most common types of cancer in children?

This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD. Records of 41 patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40: 0 to 10, excellent; 11 to 20 good; 21 to 30 fair; 31 to 40 poor. A 2-tailed Student t test, analysis of covariance, as well as logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the collected data with confidence interval higher than 95%. Overall scores were similar. However, continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group.

When a tumor is too large to be removed through surgery, it is often removed through the lymphatic system, which has the greatest capacity for clearing cancers. However, some patients with advanced metastatic disease may require removal of the whole tumor. Transabdominal transanal pull-through surgery can help to reduce this complication.\n\nWhat side effects are reported after transabdominal transanal pull-through surgery?\n\nVery few cases of radiation exposure occur after transabdominal transanal pull-through surgery. However, some complications in patients are reported. These may include a fever (which has not been linked to the transanal pull-through procedure), nausea or vomiting, lymphadenopathy, bleeding or infections, and other problems that are related to the transanal pull-through procedure. These complications usually resolve within a few weeks to a few months.\n\nIs there a cure for breast cancer?\n\nAs of 2007, there is no cure for breast cancer.

However, it remains unknown if they can predict more definitive endpoints, such as PCSM.

HRT should be used only in conjunction with an active disease-modifying therapy. Women who cannot use HRT because they have an estrogen-receptor-positive tumor should not start to take estrogen. Individuals who cannot take HRT because of a family history of breast cancer or a family history of ovarian cancer should not begin to take estrogen.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate form of HRT for my condition? HRT should not be used unless it has been shown to provide clinically significant and specific benefit.

It was once thought that the presence of visceral adipose tissue was the only risk factor, but recent studies have shown an association with various factors including high cholesterol levels, physical inactivity, and smoking [ 6, 7, 8 ]. However, these associations remain inconclusive and, in part, have been explained by the variable results of different studies [ 9, 10 ]. Although it is not yet known if these studies are informative, a large recent study has identified that BMI and the ratio of waist-to-hip ratio (BMI) are strongly associated with VAT and the associated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), while obesity and waist-to-hip ratio are associated with less risk of CHD and incident stroke [ 6 ]. However, the results of a number of cross-sectional studies indicate that the association of VAT is more complex and may also include many other risk factors, and therefore a total picture of total risk is needed to provide a clear picture of risk [ 8, 11 ].\n\nThe amount of fat in the abdomen is referred to as visceral fat. It consists of visceral fat tissue, which grows after visceral fat is produced from fat storage in the liver [ 24 ]. The main circulating tissue for VAT is the liver, which is also the site of the production of fat for synthesis of various hormones such as insulin, leptin, dihydrotestosterone, and sex steroid hormones, as well as insulinlike growth factor. It is important to note that as VAT tends to accumulate in the visceral adipose tissue and not the liver, this tissue is most frequently referred to as abdominal fat.\n\nAlthough a number of studies have suggested that a higher BMI can increase the risk of cardiovascular events and type 2 diabetes [ 17, 19 ], a recent large study from the University of Pittsburgh showed that the high BMI in men and women and low waist-to-hip ratios were strongly associated with both increased total and ischaemic CHD risk. However, although the associations between BMI and CHD events were generally consistent, there was some evidence of increased risk with increased waist circumference [ 19 ]. This risk may be because of the high concentration of visceral fat in the abdominal region [ 19, 20 ] and the low density of organs in the abdominal region [ 17 ], or due to additional fat accumulation due to a larger body of abdominal fat [ 20, 21 ].\n\nAlthough the use of the abdominal fat index is the most widely used measurement of adiposity, other methods such as the"}

We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003. Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years.

Retrospective cohort study. Three northern California family planning clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up. Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any follow-up recommendation (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93], and for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73]).", "question": "Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence?", "answer": "no. Adherence to follow-up was low in this family planning clinic population, no matter what type of follow-up was advised. Adherence was improved by the use of up to 3 reminders.

To verify the feasibility of developing a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach, an alternative to optical analysis, as a rapid, accurate, and automated tool for the detection and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa. The traditional cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-based method was modified for DNA isolation from pollen. Taxon-specific DNA sequences were identified via bioinformatics or literature searches and were PCR amplified from the matching allergenic taxa; based on the sequences of PCR products, complementary or degenerate TaqMan probes were developed. The accuracy of the quantitative real-time PCR assay was tested on 3 plant species. The setup of a modified DNA extraction protocol allowed us to achieve good-quality pollen DNA.

Histologic, ultrastructural, and cohesive tensile strength evaluations were performed on 25 normal human corneal specimens, 206 uncomplicated LASIK specimens, 17 uncomplicated sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK) specimens, 4 uncomplicated photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) specimens, 2 uncomplicated advanced surface ablation (ASA) specimens, 5 keratoconus specimens, 12 postoperative LASIK ectasia specimens, and 1 postoperative PRK ectasia specimen and compared to previously published studies. Histologic and ultrastructural studies of normal corneas showed significant differences in the direction of collagen fibrils and/or the degree of lamellar interweaving in Bowman's layer, the anterior third of the corneal stroma, the posterior two-thirds of the corneal stroma, and Descemet's membrane. Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring. In contrast, similar to conventional LASIK, SBK still has the short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar.", "question": "Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?", "answer": "yes.

Symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, chills, nausea and vomiting. Infections can also be caused by:\n\nEnterococci:\n\nThis microorganism causes cold and sinus infection and may be spread to the lungs. \n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease:\n\nA bacterial infection linked to severe diarrhea and often accompanied by fever. \n\nPneumonia:\n\nIt can cause pneumonia, requiring antibiotics. Infections can also be spread by:\n\nShigellosis:\n\nThis condition can cause severe diarrhea, and the patient is often advised to rest, especially at night. Inflammation of the stomach may worsen symptoms. \n\nHow is gangrene treated?\n\nAspiration for surgical intervention is recommended to be the primary treatment. Infusion of antibiotics and intravenous fluids to relieve discomfort. Treatment should be continued until infection is controlled. \n\nWhat are other treatments?\n\nMany patients require multiple courses of antibiotics before they are able to return to a normal lifestyle. Treatment options include surgery and/or chemotherapy. Sometimes, antibiotic therapy alone is not sufficient to treat this disease."}

Although selective and non-selective methods of preoperative carotid screening have been advocated, it remains unclear if this screening is clinically relevant.AIM: To test whether selective carotid screening is as effective as non-selective screening in detecting significant carotid disease. The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke: peripheral vascular disease (PVD), carotid bruit, diabetes mellitus, age>70 years and/or history of cerebrovascular disease. Prevalence of carotid stenosis detected by ultrasonography, surgical management and perioperative stroke rates were determined in each group. Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05).
