{"id": 21645374, "url": "", "subject": "", "topic": "", "context": "Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.", "question": "Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?", "answer": "yes. Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "generated_answer": "Yes, mitochondria are capable of initiating cell death but the function of their effect is poorly understood.\n\nThe stem cells that make up muscle are also capable of causing cell death.

Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01).", "question": "Assessment of carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery. Is it always necessary?", "answer": "no. In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged>70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact on surgical management or neurological outcomes.", "generated_answer": "Carotid artery stenosis causes severe pain and discomfort. Treatment with surgery usually makes the condition less severe. Is carotid stenosis usually the same? A surgical procedure known as stenting has been used in almost all cases of carotid artery stenosis. Surgery requires removal of the obstruction. Common treatments are angioplasty or angioplasty plus a stent. Which is more common? Angioplasty is usually used in people who already have a narrowing of the carotid artery. The other treatment is angioplasty plus a stent. What do the results of an angioplasty or angioplasty plus a stent look like? Angioplasty may lead to scarring or a narrowing of the carotid artery. The stent may reduce the amount of damage. Surgery may reduce the amount of damage by removing the obstruction. What is the outcome of angioplasty or angioplasty plus a stent? This is the only treatment for carotid artery stenosis. Sometimes the obstructing clot is removed surgically, but often it is left behind. What other treatments are available for this condition? Common medications such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors"}
