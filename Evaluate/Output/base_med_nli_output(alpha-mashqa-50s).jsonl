The grief process is normal, and most people go through it. But when grief takes over your life and you begin to feel hopeless, helpless, and worthless, then it's time to talk to your doctor about telling the difference between normal grief and depression. Grief is a natural response to death or loss. The grieving process is an opportunity to appropriately mourn a loss and then heal. The process is helped when you acknowledge grief, find support, and allow time for grief to work. Each year, between 5% and 9% of the population loses a close family member. But that's not the only kind of loss that can cause grief. People can feel loss when: They become separated from a loved one They lose a job, position, or income A pet dies or runs away Kids leave home They have a major change in life such as getting a divorce, moving, or retiring While we all feel grief and loss, and each of us is unique in the ways we cope with our feelings. Some people have healthy coping skills. They're able to feel grief without losing sight of their daily responsibilities. Other people don't have the coping skills or support they need. That hinders the grieving process. There are specific stages of grief. They reflect common reactions people have as they try to make sense of a loss. An important part of the healing process is feeling and accepting the emotions that come as a result of the loss. People go through common stages of grief: Denial, numbness, and shock: Numbness is a normal reaction to a death or loss and should never be confused with \"not caring.\" This stage of grief helps protect us from experiencing the intensity of the loss. It can be useful when we have to take some action, such as planning a funeral, notifying relatives, or reviewing important papers. As we move through the experience and slowly acknowledges its impact, the initial denial and disbelief fades. Bargaining: This stage of grief may be marked by persistent thoughts about what \"could have been done\" to prevent the death or loss. Some people become obsessed with thinking about specific ways things could have been done differently to save the person's life or prevent the loss. If this stage of grief isn't dealt with and resolved, the person may live with intense feelings of guilt or anger that can interfere with the healing process. Depression: In this stage, we begin to realize and feel the true extent of the death or loss. Common signs of depression in this stage include trouble sleeping, poor appetite, fatigue, lack of energy, and crying spells. We may also have self-pity and feel lonely, isolated, empty, lost, and anxious. Anger: This stage is common. It usually happens when we feel helpless and powerless. Anger can stem from a feeling of abandonment because of a death or loss. Sometimes we're angry at a higher power, at the doctors who cared for a lost loved one, or toward life in general. Acceptance: In time, we can come to terms with all the emotions and feelings we experienced when the death or loss happened. Healing can begin once the loss becomes integrated into our set of life experiences. Throughout our lives, we may return to some of the earlier stages of grief, such as depression or anger. Because there are no rules or time limit to the grieving process, everyone's healing process will be different. Some things can impede or slow down the healing process following a death or loss. They include: Avoiding emotions Compulsive behaviors Minimizing feelings Overworking on the job Misusing drugs, alcohol, or other substances as a way to deal with emotional discomfort Acknowledge and accept both positive and negative feelings. Allow plenty of time to experience thoughts and feelings. Confide in a trusted person about the loss. Express feelings openly or write journal entries about them. Find bereavement groups in which there are other people who've had similar losses. Remember that crying can provide a release. Seek professional help if feelings are overwhelming. If grief continues and causes a prolonged and deep depression with physical symptoms such as poor sleep, loss of appetite, weight loss, and even thoughts of suicide, you may have a condition known as complicated bereavement. Talk with your doctor as soon as possible. Sometimes, a major depression can develop along with the normal feelings of loss or sadness linked with grief. Whereas normal sadness as part of a grief reaction may subside after several months, major depression is a medical disorder that is different from normal grief, can occur at any time (even in the immediate aftermath of a death of loss), and requires treatment to be resolved.", "question": "Can a doctor help me tell the difference between grief and depression?", "answer": ["The grief process is normal, and most people go through it.

Your doctor may suggest this if your medicine isn't working, your symptoms get worse, or your ulcerative colitis leads to serious complications.

You may have had a small hole in it or something more severe. Although these can be very serious conditions, many can be treated with surgery. In some cases, doctors can find these problems during pregnancy. You might not get symptoms until adulthood, or you may not get any at all. Doctors don't always know why a baby has a congenital heart defect. They tend to run in families. Things that make them more likely include: Problems with genes or chromosomes in the child, such as Down syndrome Taking certain medications, or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy A viral infection, like rubella ( German measles) in the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy Most congenital heart problems are structural issues like holes and leaky valves. For instance: Heart valve defects: One may be too narrow or completely closed. That makes it hard for blood to get through. Sometimes, it can't get through at all. In other cases, the valve might not close properly, so the blood leaks backward. Problems with the heart's \"walls\": It could be the ones between the chambers (atria and ventricles) of your heart. Holes or passageways between the left and right side of the heart might cause blood to mix when it shouldn't. Issues with the heart's muscle: These can lead to heart failure, which means the heart doesn't pump as efficiently as it should. Bad connections among blood vessels: In babies, this may let blood that should go to the lungs go to other parts of the body instead, or vice versa. These defects can deprive blood of oxygen and lead to organ failure. It's possible for you to have a heart-related birth defect and not have symptoms. If you do, they can include: Shortness of breath Problems with exercise The symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and children may include: A bluish tint to the skin, fingernails, and lips (doctors call this cyanosis, a condition caused by a lack of oxygenated blood) Fast breathing and poor feeding Poor weight gain Lung infections An inability to exercise Doctors may find some problems before a baby is born. Other problems may be found in infants, kids, or adults. The doctor listens to your heartbeat to check your health. If she hears an unusual sound or heart murmur, she might order more tests, such as: Echocardiogram: A type of ultrasound that takes pictures of your heart. There are different kinds, so ask your doctor what you can expect. Cardiac catheterization: A doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. She puts dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart. Chest X-ray: These can reveal signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG): This measures the heart's electrical activity. MRI : You get a scan that lets doctors see the heart's structure. You might not need any treatment. Or you may need medications, surgery, or other procedures. If you have congenital heart disease, you'll need to see a heart specialist on a regular basis. People with congenital heart defects are more likely to have inflammation of the inner layer of their heart (a condition doctors call endocarditis), especially if their heart was repaired or replaced through surgery. To protect yourself: Tell all doctors and dentists you have congenital heart disease. You may want to carry a card with this information. Call your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection (sore throat, general body aches, fever). Take good care of your teeth and gums to prevent infections. Make regular visits to your dentist. Take antibiotics before you have any medical work that may cause bleeding, like dental work and most surgeries.

Early research shows benefits for this hard-to-treat form of cancer. Mesothelioma often starts in your pleura, a thin lining between your lung and the inside of your chest. Usually, it affects people who've breathed in asbestos, a material used in roofing and insulation. Tiny asbestos fibers go into your lungs and cause cancer cells to grow in the lining. Right now, the only FDA-approved mesothelioma treatments are chemotherapy, like cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pemetrexed. Doctors are looking at other options, like immunotherapy, that could offer hope. Where Is Immunotherapy Now? Larger clinical trials with more mesothelioma patients will offer a better look at how well immunotherapy works and what side effects it can cause. These drugs are being studied for mesothelioma now: Atezolizumab ( Tecentriq) Durvalumab ( Imfinzi) Ipilimumab ( Yervoy) Nivolumab ( Opdivo) Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) Tremelimumab How Does Immunotherapy Work? Unlike chemotherapy drugs, which kill both cancer and healthy cells, immunotherapy is more targeted. It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer. White blood cells in your immune system spot cells that aren't supposed to be in your body, like bacteria or viruses. Immunotherapy drugs tell the white blood cells to sense certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells, then seek out and destroy those cells. Block the Blocker It sounds simple, but in mesothelioma, these proteins can block your immune system's attack. They're called checkpoints. They distract your white blood cells so they don't attack the cancer inside. Checkpoint proteins include PD-1 and PD- L1. Immunotherapy drugs like atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab are called checkpoint inhibitors because they block the proteins' defense. Checkpoints normally act as an off switch for immune cells attacking tumor cells. Immunotherapy reveals the tumor cells. The checkpoint inhibitor pulls the mask off so the immune cells can do their job. When Is It Used? Mesothelioma is hard to treat because its tumor cells are high in checkpoints. So current trials test different mixes of immunotherapy drugs, as well as use of immunotherapy to rev up your immune system before cancer surgery. The results: People who've failed other treatments often respond well to immunotherapy. Right now, immunotherapy is mainly given to people with mesothelioma in clinical trials.. So how and when do you know if you should sign up for one? Every trial is different. Each has its own requirements for who can enroll based on the type of mesothelioma you have and what treatments you've already tried that didn't work. You and your doctor can talk about immunotherapy when you're diagnosed and go over your treatment options. The type of mesothelioma you have and how far it has spread will help you decide if you should try chemotherapy or surgery first. Usually, you go into a drug trial if other treatments have failed. But some mesothelioma immunotherapy trials don't require that. How Do You Take Immunotherapy? These drugs are all given as infusions, so you go to a clinic to get an IV drip every 2 to 3 weeks. Immunotherapy can cause side effects including diarrhea, nausea, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, and inflamed organs. Next Steps Researchers want to find biomarkers, like genes or those proteins on the tumors, that could help immunotherapy drugs better hit their targets. Also, most people don't respond to a single drug, so scientists are looking into combinations with surgery, other cancer drugs, and other immunotherapies. More trials on more patients with mesothelioma may tell us how well they work in different types of this cancer, and why they seem to work when other drugs have failed. Doctors will go back and figure out why people had the response they did, whether it was partial or very good. One day, you might not have to wait until other treatments fail first to try immunotherapy. If things keep going the way they are, it could soon become a front-line treatment for mesothelioma.", "question": "How does cancer immunotherapy work?", "answer": ["It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer.

You usually can't get scabies from quick touching, like a handshake or a hug. Itchy hands and feet are common in infants and young kids with scabies, but not adults. It also causes: Itchiness, especially at night, of the entire body or specific areas, like the wrist, elbow, armpit, and the webbing between fingers Pimply rash Tiny blisters and scales Sores Grayish-white or skin-colored âburrowsâ that look like lines Could It Be Diabetes? A skin problem is sometimes the first sign that you have diabetes. One of these skin conditions is eruptive xanthomatosis, which can make hands and feet itch. It's caused by out-of-control diabetes, and it goes away when the disease is managed well. It can also make you itchy on your arms, legs, and buttocks. Other signs of eruptive xanthomatosis: Small, yellow bumps on the skin Redness around the bumps High cholesterol Could It Be Allergies? Your skin can have an allergic reaction to something you touch. The response you see and feel is another type of eczema called allergic contact dermatitis. Symptoms may not appear for a few hours after you touch the item you're allergic to. When they do appear, you may feel itchy and have: Rash Very dry skin Burning and stinging Hives Blisters In general, the answer hinges on what's making your hands and feet itch. Ointments, creams, and lotions can help when dry skin is to blame. If those don't keep you from scratching, talk to your doctor to figure out what's right for you. An allergic reaction may need antihistamines or corticosteroids, whether over-the-counter or prescribed by your doctor. Some products treat scabies by killing the mites on your body. Skin conditions like psoriasis or eczema often require a more detailed treatment plan. Whatever the cause, don't just put up with the itch.

Some common health conditions are linked with vascular disease and clogged arteries: Coronary artery disease (clogged arteries in the heart) High blood pressure Diabetes High cholesterol Obesity Peripheral vascular disease, which affects the blood vessels that send blood to the arms, hands, legs, and feet If you have one of these conditions, it's more likely that the problem can affect the blood vessels in your penis and cause erectile dysfunction. Also, smoking greatly raises your chances for clogged arteries and vascular disease. If you have erectile dysfunction, it helps to kick the habit. Your penis must store blood to keep an erection. If the veins can't keep blood there during an erection, you'll lose it. This is called venous leak. It may happen with vascular disease.

This means you'll get more than one treatment at the same time to attack the cancer cells. Years ago, the main weapons that doctors used to fight cancer were surgery, chemotherapy (strong medicine that kills healthy cells along with cancer cells), and radiation. Today, there are many new tools, like immunotherapy, which boosts your body's own immune system to help it fight cancer, and targeted therapy, which targets and attacks certain mutated genes or proteins that are in some forms of cancer without harming normal cells. Often, when doctors combine two or more ways fight cancer, they have a greater result than when they use only one cancer-fighting weapon at a time. This type of treatment lets them attack cancer from many angles at the same time, so there are fewer places for it to hide. This makes it more likely that the treatments will help. Your doctor will decide what type is best for you based on your health and the type of melanoma you have. He'll also choose the best option to try first. Some treatments may never be right for you, if your form of melanoma doesn't have certain mutated genes or proteins. You may have more severe side effects than if you only got one treatment at a time. Your doctor may choose to stop one if the side effects are too severe. He may also stop a treatment if you don't improve by a certain time. Your doctor may suggest these combinations: Research has shown that using two drugs to treat stage IV melanoma works better than using just one. Cancer can trick your immune system into leaving it alone. These meds âwake upâ your body so you can fight back. When ipilimumab ( Yervoy) is paired with either nivolumab ( Opdivo) or pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) survival rates are better than treating with ipilimumab alone. Your doctor will know whether or not this drug combo is right for you. You could be more likely to have a serious heart problem or other severe side effects than if you only took one of the drugs. Some of today's newer cancer treatments target certain mutated genes or proteins that cancer needs to thrive or survive. If your melanoma has them, you can take a medication to attack them. About half the people with melanoma have a change to their genes called BRAF. Other people have a certain protein called MEK that helps melanoma grow and thrive. If your cancer has them, the doctor may give you a mix of binimetinib ( Mektovi) and encorafenib ( Braftovi), dabrafenib ( Tafinlar) and trametinib ( Mekinist) or two other drugs called cobimetinib ( Cotellic) andvemurafenib ( Zelboraf).

Your back is at the mercy of bad habits like: Slouching at your desk Lifting and pulling heavy objects with your back rather your legs Being overweight Not exercising enough Smoking Wearing high heels Carrying an overloaded backpack All of these things can lead to lower back pain. You may carry your stress in your back -- the muscles feel like they're in knots. And the pain can feel much worse if you're also depressed or anxious. Falling down, getting into a car accident, or even overdoing it in that pick-up game over the weekend can cause problems you feel in your lower back, like: Spine/vertebral fractures: Your back may have a broken bone if it gets hit hard or you fall from a great height. Sprains and strains: Lifting and twisting at the same time, or swinging a golf club, can pull or tear the ligaments, muscles, and tendons in your back. Spasms: These are muscle contractions, and they hurt. They generally happen when you sprain or strain your lower back. In many cases, the pain happens when parts of the back -- the spine, joints, tissues, muscles, and the discs that cushion the spinal bones (vertebrae) -- are out of sync. If your back isn't feeling quite right, have your doctor check for: Herniated or slipped discs: The bones of your spine are cushioned by discs, often referred to as âshock absorbers.â When they wear down, the soft tissue between them begins to squeeze out. This is when you start to feel it -- especially if they rupture. It can happen if you've had a sudden injury, or because of simple wear and tear. Bulging discs: The stuff inside your discs âbulges,â but not as much as with a herniated disc. They often cause no symptoms on their own, but they can bring pain if the disc pushes up against a nerve root. Degenerative disc disease: The discs that separate your vertebrae wear down. This sometimes causes the bones to rub together. Age is usually the reason, but sports and injuries can be culprits, too. Inflammation and movement problems of the sacroiliac joint: This joint sits at the bottom of the spine, on either side of the pelvis. It transfers the weight of your upper body to your lower body. This can start to bother you after you've been injured, if you have an infection, if you have arthritis, or if you're pregnant. Abnormal movement, such as too much movement of the joint, can also cause long-term pain. Lumbar spinal stenosis : If you're over age 60, there's a decent chance this is your culprit. As you age, your spinal canal narrows. That change can put pressure on the nerves running through your spine. Your shoulders and legs will then start to feel numb. Cauda equina syndrome: This happens if a ruptured disc pushes down into the nerve roots in your spine. It may be what's causing your pain if bladder and bowel control have been an issue for you lately. Cervical radiculopathy : This is a pinched nerve in your neck that is usually caused by a bone spur or herniated disc. Sciatica: This may be your cause if you have a sharp pain in your lower back or hip. It happens when a herniated disc presses on the nerves in your lower spine. Arthritis: This causes stiffness, swelling, and inflammation in your joints. If your doctor mentions âankylosing spondylitis,â he's talking about a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the joints and ligaments along your spine. Osteoarthritis : This is when your cartilage and bone begin to break down and there is inflammation. Scoliosis: You may hear this called âcurvature of the spine.â If you have it, chances are you were born with it. Pain tied to it usually starts at about middle age. Spondylolisthesis: If your doctor mentions this, a bone in the spine has slipped out of place, probably in your lower back. This can be seen by X-ray or MRI. Spinal stenosis: This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that causes pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. It's usually from arthritis or bony growth from wear and tear.

This is when you start to feel it -- especially if they rupture. It can happen if you've had a sudden injury, or because of simple wear and tear. Bulging discs: The stuff inside your discs âbulges,â but not as much as with a herniated disc. They often cause no symptoms on their own, but they can bring pain if the disc pushes up against a nerve root. Degenerative disc disease: The discs that separate your vertebrae wear down. This sometimes causes the bones to rub together. Age is usually the reason, but sports and injuries can be culprits, too. Inflammation and movement problems of the sacroiliac joint: This joint sits at the bottom of the spine, on either side of the pelvis. It transfers the weight of your upper body to your lower body. This can start to bother you after you've been injured, if you have an infection, if you have arthritis, or if you're pregnant. Abnormal movement, such as too much movement of the joint, can also cause long-term pain. Lumbar spinal stenosis : If you're over age 60, there's a decent chance this is your culprit. As you age, your spinal canal narrows. That change can put pressure on the nerves running through your spine. Your shoulders and legs will then start to feel numb. Cauda equina syndrome: This happens if a ruptured disc pushes down into the nerve roots in your spine. It may be what's causing your pain if bladder and bowel control have been an issue for you lately. Cervical radiculopathy : This is a pinched nerve in your neck that is usually caused by a bone spur or herniated disc. Sciatica: This may be your cause if you have a sharp pain in your lower back or hip. It happens when a herniated disc presses on the nerves in your lower spine. Arthritis: This causes stiffness, swelling, and inflammation in your joints. If your doctor mentions âankylosing spondylitis,â he's talking about a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the joints and ligaments along your spine. Osteoarthritis : This is when your cartilage and bone begin to break down and there is inflammation. Scoliosis: You may hear this called âcurvature of the spine.â If you have it, chances are you were born with it. Pain tied to it usually starts at about middle age. Spondylolisthesis: If your doctor mentions this, a bone in the spine has slipped out of place, probably in your lower back. This can be seen by X-ray or MRI. Spinal stenosis: This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that causes pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. It's usually from arthritis or bony growth from wear and tear. Lower back pain can also be caused by other things that are going on in your body. Abdominal aortic aneurysm: If the blood vessel that supplies blood to your belly, pelvis, and legs is at risk of rupturing, you'll feel sudden pain in your lower back. Pregnancy: All that weight out front can put a real strain on your back. Tumors: They usually don't start in the back, but are part of the spread of a cancer in the spine that started somewhere else in your body. Infections: Osteomyelitis, discitis and, septic sacroiliitis are uncommon infections that affect the bones, discs, and joints of the spine. Any one of these can cause pain in your lower back. Kidney infections can also cause your back to feel the brunt. Other issues: Low back pain can also happen because of things like: Kidney stones Endometriosis, a buildup of uterine tissue outside the uterus Fibromyalgia, a condition that causes widespread muscle pain", "question": "What is degenerative disc disease?", "answer": ["Degenerative disc disease: The discs that separate your vertebrae wear down.
