The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.", "question": "Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?", "answer": "yes.

Hepatitis B is a chronic infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can occur even if there is no signs or symptoms of infection. For example, Hepatitis C infections are also known as chronic hepatitis. If you've already had hepatitis B, you should continue your regular treatment as you would for any other infection. If you haven't had hepatitis B or you have an infection that is treatable with a viral hepatitis B vaccine, you may be able to have a viral hepatitis B vaccine. Viral hepatitis B vaccine is usually given when you first get symptoms of infection (such as flu-like symptoms, headache, fever and chills), if you have any recent infections, or if you plan to travel for longer than 2 months. 18.1.

Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally.

The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "generated_answer": "\nNo. Research is incomplete on this topic. Please contact our Ombudsman for clarification.  The number of covered services used to be more important to the savings for HMOs and primary care providers compared with provider networks in Florida Medicaid. However, as more services are provided through the primary care network, they also consume more services that are previously covered by other providers. Hence, this pattern may lead to higher costs for primary care. (5)\n\n3.9% (3) percent of medical services and supplies costs for non-HMO providers and 1.3% (1) percent of medical services and supplies costs for HMOs in Florida.  This is a statistically significant finding.\n\nBased on these data and conclusions, the overall costs for primary care are relatively small. However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that primary care is more expensive, and this might be one of the reasons for differences in the cost of insurance plans in Florida. The researchers of the study noted these data and conclusions. However, to make recommendations, a medical provider who is a medical director should check with his or her medical network regarding the most suitable insurance plan based on the costs and quality of care.\n\nAs mentioned above, the overall cost of", "overall comparison": "entailment"}

Although selective and non-selective methods of preoperative carotid screening have been advocated, it remains unclear if this screening is clinically relevant.AIM: To test whether selective carotid screening is as effective as non-selective screening in detecting significant carotid disease. The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke: peripheral vascular disease (PVD), carotid bruit, diabetes mellitus, age>70 years and/or history of cerebrovascular disease. Prevalence of carotid stenosis detected by ultrasonography, surgical management and perioperative stroke rates were determined in each group. Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P<0.05).
