The grief process is normal, and most people go through it. But when grief takes over your life and you begin to feel hopeless, helpless, and worthless, then it's time to talk to your doctor about telling the difference between normal grief and depression. Grief is a natural response to death or loss. The grieving process is an opportunity to appropriately mourn a loss and then heal. The process is helped when you acknowledge grief, find support, and allow time for grief to work. Each year, between 5% and 9% of the population loses a close family member. But that's not the only kind of loss that can cause grief. People can feel loss when: They become separated from a loved one They lose a job, position, or income A pet dies or runs away Kids leave home They have a major change in life such as getting a divorce, moving, or retiring While we all feel grief and loss, and each of us is unique in the ways we cope with our feelings. Some people have healthy coping skills. They're able to feel grief without losing sight of their daily responsibilities. Other people don't have the coping skills or support they need. That hinders the grieving process. There are specific stages of grief. They reflect common reactions people have as they try to make sense of a loss. An important part of the healing process is feeling and accepting the emotions that come as a result of the loss. People go through common stages of grief: Denial, numbness, and shock: Numbness is a normal reaction to a death or loss and should never be confused with \"not caring.\" This stage of grief helps protect us from experiencing the intensity of the loss. It can be useful when we have to take some action, such as planning a funeral, notifying relatives, or reviewing important papers. As we move through the experience and slowly acknowledges its impact, the initial denial and disbelief fades. Bargaining: This stage of grief may be marked by persistent thoughts about what \"could have been done\" to prevent the death or loss. Some people become obsessed with thinking about specific ways things could have been done differently to save the person's life or prevent the loss. If this stage of grief isn't dealt with and resolved, the person may live with intense feelings of guilt or anger that can interfere with the healing process. Depression: In this stage, we begin to realize and feel the true extent of the death or loss. Common signs of depression in this stage include trouble sleeping, poor appetite, fatigue, lack of energy, and crying spells. We may also have self-pity and feel lonely, isolated, empty, lost, and anxious. Anger: This stage is common. It usually happens when we feel helpless and powerless. Anger can stem from a feeling of abandonment because of a death or loss. Sometimes we're angry at a higher power, at the doctors who cared for a lost loved one, or toward life in general. Acceptance: In time, we can come to terms with all the emotions and feelings we experienced when the death or loss happened. Healing can begin once the loss becomes integrated into our set of life experiences. Throughout our lives, we may return to some of the earlier stages of grief, such as depression or anger. Because there are no rules or time limit to the grieving process, everyone's healing process will be different. Some things can impede or slow down the healing process following a death or loss. They include: Avoiding emotions Compulsive behaviors Minimizing feelings Overworking on the job Misusing drugs, alcohol, or other substances as a way to deal with emotional discomfort Acknowledge and accept both positive and negative feelings. Allow plenty of time to experience thoughts and feelings. Confide in a trusted person about the loss. Express feelings openly or write journal entries about them. Find bereavement groups in which there are other people who've had similar losses. Remember that crying can provide a release. Seek professional help if feelings are overwhelming. If grief continues and causes a prolonged and deep depression with physical symptoms such as poor sleep, loss of appetite, weight loss, and even thoughts of suicide, you may have a condition known as complicated bereavement. Talk with your doctor as soon as possible. Sometimes, a major depression can develop along with the normal feelings of loss or sadness linked with grief. Whereas normal sadness as part of a grief reaction may subside after several months, major depression is a medical disorder that is different from normal grief, can occur at any time (even in the immediate aftermath of a death of loss), and requires treatment to be resolved.", "question": "Can a doctor help me tell the difference between grief and depression?", "answer": ["The grief process is normal, and most people go through it.

These medications should not be an outlet for grief. While they're used to alleviate specific issues, they're often ineffective and are associated with serious side effects.\n\nQ: Can you donate your organs to save someone else's life?\n\nA: Yes. The World Health Organization has developed guidelines for organ donors that include mental health.\n\nQ: Is there such a thing as'self-harm'?\n\nA: Self-harm is a coping mechanism to relieve stress, which may be common among patients experiencing depression. This coping strategy can have devastating consequences, including suicide. If you have a mental health problem, talk with your doctor about finding a mental health specialist in your area. They can help you identify the issues that can be addressed and improve your quality of life.\n\nQ: Can you buy and sell drugs?\n\nA: Yes. People who are abusing drugs like cocaine and amphetamines and hallucinogenic substances have often serious mental health problems, including suicidal thoughts.

You may have had a small hole in it or something more severe. Although these can be very serious conditions, many can be treated with surgery. In some cases, doctors can find these problems during pregnancy. You might not get symptoms until adulthood, or you may not get any at all. Doctors don't always know why a baby has a congenital heart defect. They tend to run in families. Things that make them more likely include: Problems with genes or chromosomes in the child, such as Down syndrome Taking certain medications, or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy A viral infection, like rubella ( German measles) in the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy Most congenital heart problems are structural issues like holes and leaky valves. For instance: Heart valve defects: One may be too narrow or completely closed. That makes it hard for blood to get through. Sometimes, it can't get through at all. In other cases, the valve might not close properly, so the blood leaks backward. Problems with the heart's \"walls\": It could be the ones between the chambers (atria and ventricles) of your heart. Holes or passageways between the left and right side of the heart might cause blood to mix when it shouldn't. Issues with the heart's muscle: These can lead to heart failure, which means the heart doesn't pump as efficiently as it should. Bad connections among blood vessels: In babies, this may let blood that should go to the lungs go to other parts of the body instead, or vice versa. These defects can deprive blood of oxygen and lead to organ failure. It's possible for you to have a heart-related birth defect and not have symptoms. If you do, they can include: Shortness of breath Problems with exercise The symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and children may include: A bluish tint to the skin, fingernails, and lips (doctors call this cyanosis, a condition caused by a lack of oxygenated blood) Fast breathing and poor feeding Poor weight gain Lung infections An inability to exercise Doctors may find some problems before a baby is born. Other problems may be found in infants, kids, or adults. The doctor listens to your heartbeat to check your health. If she hears an unusual sound or heart murmur, she might order more tests, such as: Echocardiogram: A type of ultrasound that takes pictures of your heart. There are different kinds, so ask your doctor what you can expect. Cardiac catheterization: A doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. She puts dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart. Chest X-ray: These can reveal signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG): This measures the heart's electrical activity. MRI : You get a scan that lets doctors see the heart's structure. You might not need any treatment. Or you may need medications, surgery, or other procedures. If you have congenital heart disease, you'll need to see a heart specialist on a regular basis. People with congenital heart defects are more likely to have inflammation of the inner layer of their heart (a condition doctors call endocarditis), especially if their heart was repaired or replaced through surgery. To protect yourself: Tell all doctors and dentists you have congenital heart disease. You may want to carry a card with this information. Call your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection (sore throat, general body aches, fever). Take good care of your teeth and gums to prevent infections. Make regular visits to your dentist. Take antibiotics before you have any medical work that may cause bleeding, like dental work and most surgeries.

Your doctor may call it a â DMARD,â which is a type of RA drug. ( DMARD stands for disease-modifying antirheumatic drug). You can take methotrexate in either pills or shots. There are prefilled methotrexate shots that are easy to take at home. You will take 7.5 to 10 milligrams each week. Your doctor may raise that to 20-25 milligrams per week if needed. The pills will come with directions about how many to take and when. If you're not sure about those instructions, ask your doctor or a pharmacist. Shots work better for some people, especially if you forget to take your pills on schedule or if the pills cause nausea. Methotrexate liquid comes in vials with a hypodermic needle or in prefilled pens with various doses. You inject the drug under the skin on your stomach or thigh. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to do this at home. If you use a prefilled pen, you'll stick the pen into your stomach or thigh and press on it to inject the drug.

How can methotrexate be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis?\nMethotrexate has a lower risk of causing an auto-immune disorder called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which, in turn, can be a precursor to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) offers information about the medical condition at least once a year to anyone who needs it. The following information about SLE is for adults and children. The NIH recommends that SLE patients who have the disease use a medication called rosiglitazone for several months before they start the disease-modifying therapy prescribed by their doctor. This medication prevents the progression of the disease. The NIH recommends that patients with SLE stop taking rosiglitazone for several months before starting the disease-modifying therapy.

Early research shows benefits for this hard-to-treat form of cancer. Mesothelioma often starts in your pleura, a thin lining between your lung and the inside of your chest. Usually, it affects people who've breathed in asbestos, a material used in roofing and insulation. Tiny asbestos fibers go into your lungs and cause cancer cells to grow in the lining. Right now, the only FDA-approved mesothelioma treatments are chemotherapy, like cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pemetrexed. Doctors are looking at other options, like immunotherapy, that could offer hope. Where Is Immunotherapy Now? Larger clinical trials with more mesothelioma patients will offer a better look at how well immunotherapy works and what side effects it can cause. These drugs are being studied for mesothelioma now: Atezolizumab ( Tecentriq) Durvalumab ( Imfinzi) Ipilimumab ( Yervoy) Nivolumab ( Opdivo) Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) Tremelimumab How Does Immunotherapy Work? Unlike chemotherapy drugs, which kill both cancer and healthy cells, immunotherapy is more targeted. It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer. White blood cells in your immune system spot cells that aren't supposed to be in your body, like bacteria or viruses. Immunotherapy drugs tell the white blood cells to sense certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells, then seek out and destroy those cells. Block the Blocker It sounds simple, but in mesothelioma, these proteins can block your immune system's attack. They're called checkpoints. They distract your white blood cells so they don't attack the cancer inside. Checkpoint proteins include PD-1 and PD- L1. Immunotherapy drugs like atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab are called checkpoint inhibitors because they block the proteins' defense. Checkpoints normally act as an off switch for immune cells attacking tumor cells. Immunotherapy reveals the tumor cells. The checkpoint inhibitor pulls the mask off so the immune cells can do their job. When Is It Used? Mesothelioma is hard to treat because its tumor cells are high in checkpoints. So current trials test different mixes of immunotherapy drugs, as well as use of immunotherapy to rev up your immune system before cancer surgery. The results: People who've failed other treatments often respond well to immunotherapy. Right now, immunotherapy is mainly given to people with mesothelioma in clinical trials.. So how and when do you know if you should sign up for one? Every trial is different. Each has its own requirements for who can enroll based on the type of mesothelioma you have and what treatments you've already tried that didn't work. You and your doctor can talk about immunotherapy when you're diagnosed and go over your treatment options. The type of mesothelioma you have and how far it has spread will help you decide if you should try chemotherapy or surgery first. Usually, you go into a drug trial if other treatments have failed. But some mesothelioma immunotherapy trials don't require that. How Do You Take Immunotherapy? These drugs are all given as infusions, so you go to a clinic to get an IV drip every 2 to 3 weeks. Immunotherapy can cause side effects including diarrhea, nausea, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, and inflamed organs. Next Steps Researchers want to find biomarkers, like genes or those proteins on the tumors, that could help immunotherapy drugs better hit their targets. Also, most people don't respond to a single drug, so scientists are looking into combinations with surgery, other cancer drugs, and other immunotherapies. More trials on more patients with mesothelioma may tell us how well they work in different types of this cancer, and why they seem to work when other drugs have failed. Doctors will go back and figure out why people had the response they did, whether it was partial or very good. One day, you might not have to wait until other treatments fail first to try immunotherapy. If things keep going the way they are, it could soon become a front-line treatment for mesothelioma.", "question": "How does cancer immunotherapy work?", "answer": ["It spurs your own defenses to fight the cancer.

It itches. It burns. It hurts. So when a flare turns painful, you want relief -- ASAP. Having some remedies on hand can soothe your sore skin when you need it the most. Before you do anything, make sure you don't have a bigger problem on your hands. If the pain is really bad or your skin is crusty yellow or oozing, call your doctor. That's a sign of an infection. It can spread and become much worse than a regular flare. You may need an antibiotic. Otherwise, try these self-care tips for the pain and itch. Quench thirsty skin. Your psoriasis may be uncomfortable because your skin is dry, scaly, and inflamed. A moisturizer is your friend. Thicker or greasier is usually better. Pick creams and ointments that come in a tub or tube. Lotions, on the other hand, tend to be watered down. Look for moisturizers with an ingredient called ceramide. Even something as basic as petroleum jelly can help your skin and lock in moisture. Soften scales. Lotions with salicylic, lactic, or glycolic acids can break up dead skins cells that build up on psoriasis plaques. Slather it on at night and cover the area with plastic wrap. This helps keep the lotion in place so you skin absorbs it better. Turn up the heat. The ingredient that makes chili peppers hot can ease pain. Check your drugstore for products with capsaicin. This can block nerve endings that transmit pain. One study showed it may help psoriasis pain, redness, swelling and other symptoms. Knock out itch. Several over-the-counter medications can control itch -- which can feel more like a burning or biting feeling when you have psoriasis.

This means you'll get more than one treatment at the same time to attack the cancer cells. Years ago, the main weapons that doctors used to fight cancer were surgery, chemotherapy (strong medicine that kills healthy cells along with cancer cells), and radiation. Today, there are many new tools, like immunotherapy, which boosts your body's own immune system to help it fight cancer, and targeted therapy, which targets and attacks certain mutated genes or proteins that are in some forms of cancer without harming normal cells. Often, when doctors combine two or more ways fight cancer, they have a greater result than when they use only one cancer-fighting weapon at a time. This type of treatment lets them attack cancer from many angles at the same time, so there are fewer places for it to hide. This makes it more likely that the treatments will help. Your doctor will decide what type is best for you based on your health and the type of melanoma you have. He'll also choose the best option to try first. Some treatments may never be right for you, if your form of melanoma doesn't have certain mutated genes or proteins. You may have more severe side effects than if you only got one treatment at a time. Your doctor may choose to stop one if the side effects are too severe. He may also stop a treatment if you don't improve by a certain time. Your doctor may suggest these combinations: Research has shown that using two drugs to treat stage IV melanoma works better than using just one. Cancer can trick your immune system into leaving it alone. These meds âwake upâ your body so you can fight back. When ipilimumab ( Yervoy) is paired with either nivolumab ( Opdivo) or pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) survival rates are better than treating with ipilimumab alone. Your doctor will know whether or not this drug combo is right for you. You could be more likely to have a serious heart problem or other severe side effects than if you only took one of the drugs. Some of today's newer cancer treatments target certain mutated genes or proteins that cancer needs to thrive or survive. If your melanoma has them, you can take a medication to attack them. About half the people with melanoma have a change to their genes called BRAF. Other people have a certain protein called MEK that helps melanoma grow and thrive. If your cancer has them, the doctor may give you a mix of binimetinib ( Mektovi) and encorafenib ( Braftovi), dabrafenib ( Tafinlar) and trametinib ( Mekinist) or two other drugs called cobimetinib ( Cotellic) andvemurafenib ( Zelboraf). They can shrink tumors and help you live longer. But there can be strong side effects. Chemotherapy isn't the first treatment choice for melanoma. But some patients with stage IV melanoma do get chemo drugs as a type of combination therapy. There are a number of drugs that your doctor can choose from, and it's likely that you'll receive more than one such drug at a time. This mix works well to shrink tumors, but it may also cause more side effects. Doctors are testing other forms of combination therapy for melanoma in clinical trials. Several treatments look like they may have promise. Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is right for you.

This means you'll get more than one treatment at the same time to attack the cancer cells. Years ago, the main weapons that doctors used to fight cancer were surgery, chemotherapy (strong medicine that kills healthy cells along with cancer cells), and radiation. Today, there are many new tools, like immunotherapy, which boosts your body's own immune system to help it fight cancer, and targeted therapy, which targets and attacks certain mutated genes or proteins that are in some forms of cancer without harming normal cells. Often, when doctors combine two or more ways fight cancer, they have a greater result than when they use only one cancer-fighting weapon at a time. This type of treatment lets them attack cancer from many angles at the same time, so there are fewer places for it to hide. This makes it more likely that the treatments will help. Your doctor will decide what type is best for you based on your health and the type of melanoma you have. He'll also choose the best option to try first. Some treatments may never be right for you, if your form of melanoma doesn't have certain mutated genes or proteins. You may have more severe side effects than if you only got one treatment at a time. Your doctor may choose to stop one if the side effects are too severe. He may also stop a treatment if you don't improve by a certain time. Your doctor may suggest these combinations: Research has shown that using two drugs to treat stage IV melanoma works better than using just one. Cancer can trick your immune system into leaving it alone. These meds âwake upâ your body so you can fight back. When ipilimumab ( Yervoy) is paired with either nivolumab ( Opdivo) or pembrolizumab ( Keytruda) survival rates are better than treating with ipilimumab alone. Your doctor will know whether or not this drug combo is right for you. You could be more likely to have a serious heart problem or other severe side effects than if you only took one of the drugs. Some of today's newer cancer treatments target certain mutated genes or proteins that cancer needs to thrive or survive. If your melanoma has them, you can take a medication to attack them. About half the people with melanoma have a change to their genes called BRAF. Other people have a certain protein called MEK that helps melanoma grow and thrive. If your cancer has them, the doctor may give you a mix of binimetinib ( Mektovi) and encorafenib ( Braftovi), dabrafenib ( Tafinlar) and trametinib ( Mekinist) or two other drugs called cobimetinib ( Cotellic) andvemurafenib ( Zelboraf). They can shrink tumors and help you live longer. But there can be strong side effects. Chemotherapy isn't the first treatment choice for melanoma. But some patients with stage IV melanoma do get chemo drugs as a type of combination therapy. There are a number of drugs that your doctor can choose from, and it's likely that you'll receive more than one such drug at a time.

Your back is at the mercy of bad habits like: Slouching at your desk Lifting and pulling heavy objects with your back rather your legs Being overweight Not exercising enough Smoking Wearing high heels Carrying an overloaded backpack All of these things can lead to lower back pain. You may carry your stress in your back -- the muscles feel like they're in knots. And the pain can feel much worse if you're also depressed or anxious.

Spasms: These are muscle contractions, and they hurt. They generally happen when you sprain or strain your lower back. In many cases, the pain happens when parts of the back -- the spine, joints, tissues, muscles, and the discs that cushion the spinal bones (vertebrae) -- are out of sync. If your back isn't feeling quite right, have your doctor check for: Herniated or slipped discs: The bones of your spine are cushioned by discs, often referred to as âshock absorbers.â When they wear down, the soft tissue between them begins to squeeze out.
